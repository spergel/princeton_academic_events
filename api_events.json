      "description": "Wednesday 9/10 @ 6:00 PM\nLabyrinth Books, 122 Nassau Street\n\nDan-el Padilla Peralta is joined by Kate Meng Brassel to discuss his new book Classicism and Other Phobias. The book, based on W.E.B. Du Bois Lectures delivered at Harvard University, draws necessary attention to the inability of the classics as a field of study to fully cope with Blackness and Black people.\nGreek and Roman antiquity have been enshrined in disciplines and curricula at all levels of education, perpetuating what the historian of political thought J.G.A. Pocock has called &amp;ldquo;a conceptual dictatorship on the rest of the planet.&amp;rdquo; Classicism and Other Phobias shows how the concept of &amp;ldquo;classicism&amp;rdquo; lacks the capacity to affirm the aesthetic value of Black life and asks whether a different kind of classicism&amp;mdash;one of insurgence, fugitivity, and emancipation&amp;mdash;is possible.\nEngaging with the work of Sylvia Wynter and other trailblazers in Black studies while drawing on his own experiences as a Black classicist, Dan-el Padilla Peralta situates the history of the classics in the racial and settler-colonialist settings of early modern and modern Europe and North America. He argues that immortalizing ancient Greek and Roman authors as &amp;ldquo;the classical&amp;rdquo; comes at the cost of devaluing Black forms of expression. Is a newfound emphasis on Black classicism the most effective counter to this phobia? In search of answers, Padilla Peralta ranges from the poetry of Juan de Castellanos to the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois and paintings by contemporary artists Kehinde Wiley and Harmonia Rosales.\nDan-el Padilla Peralta is professor of classics at Princeton University. His books include Divine Institutions: Religions and Community in the Middle Roman Republic and Undocumented: A Dominican Boy&amp;rsquo;s Odyssey from a Homeless Shelter to the Ivy League.\nKate Meng Brassel is assistant professor of classical studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to joining the faculty at Penn, she taught as the Shapiro Faculty Fellow in the Core Curriculum at Columbia and also worked in television production.\nThis event is cosponsored by The Princeton Public Library, Princeton University Press, Princeton University&amp;rsquo;s Department of Classics and Humanities Council, and Labyrinth Books.",

This paper will identify and discuss an important challenge for this way of countering the demandingness of the impartial good, namely that the impartial good would seem to be able to exercise a veto on relationships of partiality permissibly arising in the first place. It will be argued that responding to this challenge requires one",

I argue that autonomy doesn‚Äôt entail welfare subjectivity, but can ground moral standing in its absence. Although I highlight the existence of plausible views on which autonomy entails phenomenal consciousness, I primarily emphasize the need for philosophical debates about the relationship between phenomenal consciousness and moral standing to engage with neglected questions about the nature of autonomy and its possible links to consciousness,",

Other things equal, diffuse harm seems less bad than its concentrated counterpart. For example, shortening a billion happy lives by a second each seems less bad than shortening one happy life by a billion seconds (~thirty years). But this attractive thought is surprisingly difficult to maintain. Although many problems for such a view are known, a particularly vivid difficulty arises in cases that involve a sequence of social positions, each very similar to the last, such as the",

Outcome Anonymity doesn't just forbid partiality: it forbids caring who is who in a welfare distribution. After illustrating this point with four examples (including",

But while model capabilities do tend to improve over time, users‚Äô experience of AI as aconsumer productis affected by many other factors. In a draft paper, Akash Kapur and Arvind Narayanan adapt Cory Doctorow‚Äôs enshittification thesis to AI, and argue that degradation of quality is possible or even likely. Some of the reasons why AI products might get worse are familiar ones, such as market power due to user lock-in, while others are new, arising from geopolitical pressures on AI companies. The talk will discuss the symptoms of enshittification and potential ways to avert this future.Bio:Arvind Narayanan is a professor of computer science at Princeton University and the director of the Center for Information Technology Policy. He is a co-author of the bookAI Snake Oiland a newsletter of the same name which is read by 60,000 researchers, policy makers, journalists, and AI enthusiasts. He previously co-authored two widely used computer science textbooks:Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency TechnologiesandFairness in Machine Learning. Narayanan led the Princeton Web Transparency and Accountability Project to uncover how companies collect and use our personal information. His work was among the first to show how machine learning reflects cultural stereotypes. Narayanan was one of TIME‚Äôs inaugural list of 100 most influential people in AI. He is a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).In-person attendance is open to Princeton University faculty, staff and students.This talk will be livestreamed and recorded.

      "description": "In his farewell speech on January 15, 2025, President Joe Biden warned about ‚Äúthe potential rise of a tech-industrial complex.‚Äù To use the ‚Äúindustrial complex‚Äù phrase, as Biden must have known, is to risk association with a strongly conspiratorial bent in U.S. culture and politics. Nevertheless, the ‚Äúindustrial complex‚Äù captures an important idea: that legal institutions can, whether intentionally or unwittingly, foster forms of power and influence that threaten to break free of liberal constraints.This project charts the rise and impact of tech companies in public governance. It both maps the legal origins of the tech-industrial complex and describes the entrenchment of tech companies within the state itself. Bloch-Wehba argues that seeing the tech-industrial complex as a key instrument of contemporary governance also illuminates problematic disjunctions between constitutional doctrine and our contemporary political order.Bio:Hannah Bloch-Wehba is CITP‚Äôs Microsoft Visiting Professor for fall 2025. She is a legal scholar, expert on law and technology, and member of the faculty at Texas A&M University School of Law. Her scholarship focuses on how technological change reshapes public governance, with consequences for civil liberties, transparency, and accountability. Her award-winning articles on these topics have appeared or are forthcoming in the Indiana Law Journal, Northwestern University Law Review, California Law Review, BYU Law Review, Berkeley Technology Law Journal, Fordham Law Review, and many other journals. Bloch-Wehba‚Äôs fellowships include the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) and the Weizenbaum Institute (Berlin). Prior to joining the faculty at Texas A&M, Bloch-Wehba taught at Drexel University‚Äôs Thomas R. Kline School of Law and at Yale Law School. She is also an affiliated fellow at Yale Law School‚Äôs Information Society Project and an affiliated scholar at NYU School of Law‚Äôs Policing Project. Bloch-Wehba is a graduate of NYU School of Law, where she was an Institute for International Law & Justice/Law and Security Scholar, and of the University of Texas at Austin.In-person attendance is open to Princeton University faculty, staff and students.This talk will be livestreamed and recorded.

      "description": "People 60 and over are the internet‚Äôs fastest growing demographic. Many myths surround older adults‚Äô online behavior such as lacking in skills and being constantly duped. Yet research shows that many in this age group are savvy and are in fact less likely to fall for online scams than younger adults. In this talk, Eszter Hargittai shares some key insights from her bookWired Wisdomwith John Palfrey about how older adults are incorporating digital media into their lives and what they, their support networks, policy makers, and companies can do to make these experiences more beneficial.Bio:Eszter Hargittai is a professor and holds the Chair in Internet Use & Society in the Department of Communication and Media Research at the University of Zurich. She is the author or editor of six books, most recently, Wired Wisdom: How to Age Better Online (University of Chicago Press, 2025) co-authored with John Palfrey. Hargittai‚Äôs research focuses on the social and policy implications of digital media with a particular interest in digital inequality, how differences in people‚Äôs digital skills influence what they do online, and how these may translate into changes in life chances. Her work has received awards from numerous professional associations. She is an elected fellow of the International Communication Association where she is currently Fellows Chair, and an external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Her research has been supported by the US National Science Foundation, the MacArthur, Sloan, Markle, Dan David, and Russell Sage Foundations, Microsoft Research, Google, Facebook, Merck, and Nokia, among others.

Courtesy the artist and Hollybush Gardens, London and Greene Naftali, New York. Photo: Andy KeateEvent DescriptionFor four weeks in November 1998 and three weeks in March 1999 Lubaina Himid CBE RA held an artist‚Äôs residency in Porthmeor, an area of St Ives in Cornwall, England where she painted her complex and haunting series of works, Plan B. The invitation for the residency had come from a Tate St Ives curator who had read what he described as ‚Äòthe quasi-autobiographical diary‚Äô in the catalogue for a 1995 show of Himid's work called Beach House. Himid‚Äôs essay for the Beach House catalogue foregrounded an autoethnographic impulse in her writing, an impulse that added flesh to the bones of the beautiful and vibrant Beach House works in which the paintings became ciphers for a whole wealth of experiences that she conjured and remembered: experiences of sands, seas and shores from across the globe, from Beit El Ras in Zanzibar to Havana and Matanzas in Cuba, to Malibu, Santa Monica, Aldeburgh, Blackpool, Dungeness, Wells-next-to-Sea, St Ives and many, many more in between. The text weaves in and out of pleasure and horror, ease and tension, strangeness and familiarity, fire and water, and is reflected in part in the shifting architectural forms of the structures that shape the series of paintings and their wildly variable and utterly seductive colour palettes. Using Beach House as its jetty, this lecture will explore the complex, multivalent possibilities evoked by the sea in the visual art of Lubaina Himid.SponsorDepartment of Art & Archaeology",

Please check website for updates.Cosponsor(s): Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) and the Program in Archaeology | Clayburgh LectureAbstractRoman cities present a patchwork of socio-economic contrast, with enormous civic monuments mixed among more modest spaces from shops to sewers, not to mention every manner of house big and small. Whether through scale, or the diversity of the parts, even the most poorly preserved Roman cities can overwhelm our best efforts to understand their urban and social textures. This presentation explores various approaches to defining and understanding the social character and development of Roman neighborhoods, drawing on the recent excavations of the Porta Stabia neighborhood at Pompeii. These excavations, under the auspices of the University of Cincinnati and the American Academy in Rome, targeted two town blocks of the city, as well as several adjacent, civic structures (the fortification wall and gate, the streets, and the Quadriporticus); the excavations covered more than ten separate building plots (c. 4000m2) made up of shops, houses, and hospitality establishments. This ‚Äòbehind-the-scenes‚Äô view of the latest excavations at Pompeii opens up an entirely new perspective on the city, with a special focus on the lives and livelihoods of the Pompeian sub-elite.",

In this lecture, he will make several propositions as to how sound can be used as a tool to repurpose and reorient struggles for autonomy and justice. This concept will be made audible across multiple scales, juridical borders, and disciplinary boundaries. With each sound that fills this aural journey, be it a wind turbine, a customized kinetic instrument, an F35, a flute, or a voice that rings out from a witness podium, the argument will become enriched and challenged.Lawrence Abu Hamdanis a researcher, filmmaker, artist, and activist or as he puts it a \"Private Ear.\" ¬†Abu Hamdan has over a decade of experience investigating audio and has a doctorate from the University of London on the role of sound in legal investigations and political discourse.

Graham]Tuesday, February 11, 2025 @5pm ETN107 (School of Architecture)A study of Soviet factography, an avant-garde movement that employed photography, film, journalism, and mass media technologies. This is the first major English-language study of factography, an avant-garde movement of 1920s modernism. Devin Fore charts this style through the work of its key figures, illuminating factography‚Äôs position in the material culture of the early Soviet period and situating it as a precursor to the genre of documentary that arose in the 1930s. Factographers employed photography and film practices in their campaign to inscribe facts and to chronicle modernization as it transformed human experience and society. Fore considers factography in light of the period‚Äôs explosion of new media technologies‚Äîincluding radio broadcasting, sound in film, and photo-media innovations‚Äîthat allowed the press to transform culture on a massive scale.This theoretically driven study uses material from Moscow archives and little-known sources to highlight factography as distinct from documentary and Socialist Realism and to establish it as one of the major twentieth-century avant-garde forms. Fore covers works of photography, film, literature, and journalism together in his considerations of Soviet culture, the interwar avant-gardes, aesthetics, and the theory of documentary.Devin¬†Foreis Professor of German at Princeton University. He is editor ofRevoliutsiia! Demonstratsiia!

Early first century CE. From a chieftain‚Äôs grave in Hoby, Denmark. National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen.Event DescriptionThis lecture takes its lead from the artist who signed his name on the silver cups from Hoby (now in the National Museum of Denmark) as ‚ÄòCheirisophos‚Äô, meaning ‚ÄòWise Hand‚Äô. Rather than just taking the name as a playful pseudonym, it explores how the artist‚Äôs self-identification can be read alongside the scenes of diplomacy, supplication and healing on the cups themselves, which are also examples of intelligent acts of touch. In their allusions to Greek epic and drama, these scenes also draw on a long tradition in Graeco-Roman culture exploring the entangled relationship between hand and mind. As a form of enactive or extended cognition, the ‚Äòwisdom of hands‚Äô is also key to Hellenistic Greek epigrams on works of art, especially those on bronze statues by the third century BCE poet Posidippus. The notion of the ‚Äòintelligent hand‚Äô, emerging from the craft of metalwork, challenges the instrumentalist assumptions of Aristotle‚Äôs claim that the hand is simply the ‚Äòtool of tools‚Äô, asserting a form of haptic wisdom that is vital to the transmission of Greek culture, even beyond the edges of the Roman Empire.SponsorDepartment of Art & Archaeology",

Since 2014, parts of the east of Ukraine have been occupied by Russia, where the industrial extraction of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union has been superseded by the ongoing military extraction. Focusing on these different modes of extraction and exploitation, Tsymbalyuk also stays attuned to ways of resisting being turned into a fossil fuel, or what she calls resisting fossilfuelization, a concept that closely aligns with Asia Bazdyrieva‚Äôs theory of ‚Äúresourcification‚Äù (‚ÄúNo Milk, no Love‚Äù 2022). Examining coal as an archive of vegetal memory, Tsymbalyuk therefore discusses alternative narrativizations of the east of Ukraine, such as Lyuba Yakimchuk‚Äôs now canonical cycle of poems ‚ÄúApricots of the Donbas‚Äù.SponsorsDepartment of Slavic Languages and LiteraturesDepartment of Art & Archaeology",

It was closely associated with the inland town of Colophon, 15 km to the north; from the 2nd century BC onward, it was known as New Colophon, or Colophon-by-the-Sea. Prior research has shown that Notion was only intensively occupied from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD. The archaeology of Notion illuminates the turbulent history of Ionia in the Hellenistic period, and the different ways in which local communities responded to the imposition of Roman rule.This lecture reports on the results of a new program of archaeological excavation at Notion, begun in 2022 after five years of survey. As preserved, Notion is a grid-planned city, surrounded by stout fortification walls. Excavation began with examination of a centrally located courtyard house and will include investigation of other houses throughout the city as well as civic buildings, especially the Bouleuterion (Council House). Our research program also includes study of the surrounding region, including the harbor, the cemeteries, local stone quarries, and the water supply system.SponsorsProgram in Archaeology, Department of Art & ArchaeologyArchaeological Institute of America (AIA)",

Sb4Event DescriptionCosponsor(s): Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) and the Program in Archaeology | Ettinghausen LectureAbstractAkkadian art is heralded as an innovative breakthrough in large part due to its ostensibly naturalistic renderings, such as the sculptural plasticity of figural forms and the appearance of landscape-like elements seen for example on the victory stele of Naram-Sin. If we no longer assume that the pursuit of spatial illusionism guides Mesopotamian artistic production, we must ask how we should understand the radical artistic shift that occurs during the Akkadian period. Our own fascination with spatial illusionism, borne from centuries of perspectivism and the standard of Italian Renaissance artistic production, celebrates these Akkadian art works without examining their original motivating factors, nor carefully analyzing their formal characteristics. In fact, spatial illusionism is rarely evident, and instead, the emphasis can be seen to be on the corporeal existence of physical things on their own, which I connect to new, totalizing powers claimed by the Akkadian kings in their territorial unification of the southern Mesopotamian city-states. Visual analysis of Akkadian art demonstrates a singular attention to the bringing into being of material things (both animate and inanimate), but a decided absence of attention to relationships among these entities within spatial settings.",

Centered around my book,Painting Architecture in Early Renaissance Italy(Harvey Miller, Brepols, 2024), this presentation problematizes interpretations based on pictorial space and perspective, emphasizing the architectural value of buildings in narrative painting. While other publications on architecture in painting have focused on single individuals (for example Giotto), or on art produced from the late fifteenth century onwards, my book discusses three case studies by different artists produced within the first fifty years of the Quattrocento. It highlights the architectural experimentation artists carried out in this period as fundamental to the development of representational strategies, the elaboration of new structural and ornamental solutions, and the reinvention of antiquity. Rather than seeing two-dimensional buildings as inferior cognates of their large-scale three-dimensional counterparts, artists exploited the freedom afforded by their media, including luxurious materials and imaginative ornament. They therefore engage in a competitive comparison with built architecture, long before the theorization of the paragone.As it highlights the fluidity with which art and architectural practice informed each other during the early Renaissance, the book offers a contribution towards a better understanding of the broad cultural value attached to architectural forms, and encourages us to reconsider the emergence of the architect as a new kind of professional. This work also questions the art historical category of the ‚Äúpainter-architect,‚Äù often used uncritically to the detriment of art forms other than painting. I addressed this in a digital exhibition for the Sir John Soane‚Äôs Museum in London, Beyond the Painter-Architect: Artists Reinventing Architecture in Renaissance Italy, which I will also discuss during this talk. Showing that a number of craftsmen applied themselves to architectural design much earlier than canonical figures like Raphael or Michelangelo, my research underscores the intersection of art and architecture as a broad phenomenon that will help us bridge the historiographical gap between art and architectural history.Livia Lupiis a historian of art and architecture of early modern Europe, currently lecturing at the University of Warwick. Her research focuses on the intersection of artistic and architectural practice, especially in Italy, c. 1300 - c. 1500. This is the subject of her first book, Painting Architecture in Early Renaissance Italy, and of a digital exhibition she curated for the Sir John Soane's Museum: Beyond the Painter-Architect, Artists Reinventing Architecture in Renaissance Italy. She is particularly interested in the relationship between design and craft, the emergence of the architect as a new professional, and the production of artistic and architectural knowledge, exploring these issues both within Italy and in terms of its exchanges with wider Europe and the Byzantine and Ottoman empires. In addition to her research, she works as a curator, editor and translator. Her research has been funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust, the University of Warwick and the Warburg Institute.SponsorsIndex of Medieval ArtCommittee on Renaissance and Early Modern StudiesDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyProgram in Italian Studies",

He won the prestigious Charles Eliot Norton Fellowship to attend the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in 1947-48.¬† At the end of the academic year, he secured a second-year fellowship to study an unpublished portfolio of early 18thcentury castle plans commissioned by a high official of the Venetian colonial empire in Greece, Francesco Grimani.¬†¬† This project kept Andrews in Greece until 1951.¬†¬† The finished work was published in 1953 asCastles of the Moreaand won immediate praise as a minor classic.¬† The publication of 1) Elizabeth Boleman-Herring‚ÄôsFarewell to Ikaros(2006), a poignant memoir of Kevin Andrews‚Äô last days before his tragic death from drowning off the coast of Kythera on Sept. 1, 1989; 2) a revised edition by G.R.

By exploiting the information contained in human skeletal remains, the project will clarify the roles of biological factors in the durability and sustainability of pre-industrial urban societies. Newly developed osteological, chemical isotope, and genomic methods will be used in this project, together with cutting-edge tools for statistical evaluation. CityLife will evaluate the living conditions, economy, population structure, pathogen load, and immune defenses in a sample of more than 4,500 skeletons from Thessaloniki, a hotspot of European urban culture. The city offers a unique constellation to study urban life diachronically from 300 BC to AD 1,500 and investigate urbanization in a single place continuously over 1,800 years. The main objectives of the project are to a) infer urban living standards by studying secular changes in anthropometric indexes, infant diet, childhood stress, and trauma in a combined manner; b) investigate the resilience and sustainability of urban food systems by reconstructing individual diets and local supply networks; d) investigate social structures, religious cohabitation, and migration by genetically reconstructing the degree of kin and non-kin relationships; and e) explore the effects of pathogen exposure on human evolution and health by studying genes associated with increased immunological response and the oral microbiome. CityLife will examine empirically tangible aspects of biocultural development to answer the simple question of how humans became urban species.SponsorsProgram in Archaeology, Department of Art & ArchaeologySeeger Center for Hellenic StudiesProgram in the Ancient World",

Detroit Institute of Art, no. 25.32.Event DescriptionHistorical ceramics from the Islamic world are now held in elite collections worldwide. Many migrated westward during the late 19th-/early 20th-century heyday of Islamic art collecting, a time when craft skills in the Middle East were being redirected towards a new market generated by the colonial project‚Äôs fanatical harvesting of artifacts: the faking, forging, and fictionalizing of antiquities. This lecture re-encounters ceramics faking and forgery in the Middle East as a local form of highly skilled craft participation in modern global capitalism. The fictionalized objects of Islamic ceramics collecting married manual and cerebral ingenuity to create new objects of delight for elite collectors, in an environment where the structures of antiquities collection derive ultimately from colonial-era resource extraction and the structures of international banking.SponsorDepartment of Art & Archaeology",

This talk explores the social and economic changes that transformed Rome and Latium between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, focusing on the people behind the pottery. From everyday cooking pots to refined tableware, these ceramics hold clues about the lives of ancient communities‚Äîhow they worked, traded, and organized their world.¬†¬†Using advanced scientific methods like Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) alongside traditional archaeological techniques, I analyze hundreds of pottery fragments from Rome (including Sant‚ÄôOmobono and the Forum of Caesar), Gabii, and other key sites. These sherds illuminate surprising patterns of resource use, technological innovation, and growing craft specialization, painting a vivid picture of how early Roman society evolved.¬†¬†This research invites us to rethink the history of early Rome, not through the lens of its elites, but through the creativity and labor of its artisans. By bringing together science and storytelling, I uncover how these potters shaped not only their wares but also the foundation of a complex and interconnected society.About our speaker:Mattia D‚ÄôAcri received his doctorate in Classical Archaeology at the University of Missouri, Columbia, with a dissertation titled ‚ÄúPottery production and social complexity in Archaic Rome and Latium.‚Äù Previously, he earned advanced degrees in archaeology from the University of Basilicata and the University of Calabria, Italy.¬† ¬†His research primarily focuses on the archaeology of pre-Roman Italy, with a particular interest in pottery analysis and production. He has been involved in several archaeological projects, including the Torre Mordillo Archaeological Project (TMAP), where he serves as Co-director, and the Caesar‚Äôs Forum Project, the Gabii Project, the Quirinal Project, and the Venus Pompeiana Project. Mattia has received numerous awards and fellowships, such as the Donald K. Anderson Award for Outstanding Research Assistant and the Etruscan Foundation Research Fellowship. He has authored and co-authored several publications, including peer-reviewed journal articles and chapters in edited volumes, with recent works focusing on pottery production in Archaic Rome and Latium, and the analysis of archaeological ceramics from various Italian sites. He has also presented his research at numerous national and international conferences.RSVP HEREFull event details",

With profound discourses on ideology, diverse artistic styles, and outstanding calligraphers, it stands¬†out as a unique art form, deeply intertwined with its social and cultural environments. Women, however, are conspicuously underrepresented in historical accounts related to and dealing with East Asian calligraphy. This workshop aims to explore the circumstances and stories¬†about women within it.We begin with a series of questions: Is the history of East Asian calligraphy, in its terminology as well as institutions, truly as male-dominated as it appears? How did women navigate the traditional framework of calligraphy to learn and create in this art form? In what ways have their contributions been recorded and evaluated? How did they manage to find or establish their own position within the artistic and cultural domains of calligraphy? Finally, in what ways is calligraphy gendered in East Asia?Scholars specializing in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan studies will present their research on women and writing/calligraphy in East Asia. The topics include case studies as well as broader reflections on gendered writing in East Asia and their wider implications for the field. The program also includes an artist's narrative on the story of her creative journey in the modern world.In-person by invitation; Zoom is open to allSponsorsEast Asian Studies ProgramDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyTang Center for East Asian ArtContactMo Chen[email¬†protected]",

      "title": "Doctoral Symposium: Traffic",
      "description": "Tags:ph.d.Mobilizing the suggestive vocabulary of capitalism, traffic implies economies of trade and profit, usually at a distance. The word derives from the 14th-century Frenchtrafic, which once connoted nefarious or illicit intrigues, schemes, side-deals, and negotiations. While these meanings are now rare in modern usage, they indicate a history of tenuous moves across borders and bounds. If ‚Äútraffic‚Äù finds its origins in commerce, how can the crossings it describes offer new sites and subjects of analysis? Traffic speaks to the vulnerabilities of communication as well as humanistic questions about the transmissions and transformations of meaning and matter. Necessarily, these are questions about multiple and uneven scales, temporalities, and geographies, as much as the persistent legacies of development, fugitivity, and organized abandonment.This symposium probes historical and theoretical conceptions of mobility, movement, and migration to contend with and challenge expectations of architectural form and material exchange. Between signal and noise, metaphor and matter, person and thing, movement and stasis, traffic entails a dialectic between things that move and the systems that move them; the immaterial contingencies of the carrier and the material realities of the carried. It inheres in bottlenecks, encroachments, collisions, dependencies, contact zones, checkpoints, entropies, refusals, and more. We ask, how do differential loss and care undergird these varied movements through time and space? In other words, what if ‚Äúyou‚Äôre notstuck intraffic, but youaretraffic‚Äù?Reviving a tradition of doctoral-student organized symposia at the Princeton School of Architecture, this three day event gathers students and scholars from within and without architectural history to consider the methodological and historiographic contributions of ‚Äútraffic.‚Äù Starting on Friday, April 4th, and continuing through the day on Saturday, April 5th, the event is organized around thematic panels of graduate student talks. The event concludes with a keynote lecture from art historianMaggie M.

Today, the visual artifacts of nineteenth-century whaling are hidden away in maritime museums and regarded as esoteric, folk relics. But on those dusty shelves are artifacts that speak to imperialism‚Äôs global circulations and to liquidities both economic and ecological. In this lecture, I propose to read whale ivory as a temporal medium trafficked in colonial contexts. As this material circulated, changing hands between New England whalers, China Trade merchants, and Indigenous chiefs in Oceania, it became a kind of archive‚Äîone on which whalemen logged the events of their voyages and through which Indigenous people marked genealogical events of personal and tribal importance. To call ivory an archive is not to say that temporality meant the same thing for everyone who encountered it. Timekeeping was a contested issue across Oceania, particularly as imperial powers worked to standardize time zones and date lines‚Äîa project motivated by maritime navigation and it clock-based technologies and one that native people across Oceania resisted. Temporality was thus a matter of both colonial control and of native sovereignty. By examining Western and Indigenous ideas of time as well as animal rhythms‚Äîthe non-human time of whales‚Äîembedded in ivory, I show how traffic on the oceans circa 1800 registered the tensions between multiple temporalities._______The symposium is sponsored by the School of Architecture.

PK-T-AW-1015Event DescriptionLink to schedule and abstractsConference descriptionGiven the current interdisciplinary interest in the long history of the four elements, this is an opportune moment to reconsider how early modern artists thought about and imagined the ‚Äúraw materials‚Äù of which they believed their surrounding world was made. This one-day conference brings together a group of scholars to discuss early modern imageries and imaginaries of metamorphic matter at a time when the ever-growing expansion of the world was catalyzing new understandings of its properties and formation. ‚ÄúElemental‚Äù is used here in its broadest (early modern) sense, referring to the forces, principles, and ultimate constituents of physical nature. How did artists and artisans use elemental imagery to draw attention to the latent forces of nature and the transformative powers of their own craft? How did they imagine and represent the elements and other ultimate particles of the material world in an age of colonial encounters, skepticism about religious beliefs, and shifting boundaries between nature and artifice?SummarySponsorDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyContactMo Chen[email¬†protected]Related documentsConference Schedule and Abstracts",

Ca. 440 B.C. (c) Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 21.2286.Event DescriptionGordion, in central Turkey, was the capital of the Phrygian empire in Anatolia until about 600 B.C. By the mid 6th century, it came under Persian control as the Medes expanded their territory westward from their Iranian heartland. During the over 200 years of Persian control, the residents of Gordion imported a surprising amount of high quality Athenian fine ware pottery. The presence of Athenian pottery at Gordion prompts a number of questions that we will examine in this talk: HOW did it get there? Gordion lies 500 km from the Aegean and Black Sea coasts, which is unusual because exported Athenian pottery usually clings to the coasts in the Eastern Mediterranean. WHY did the residents of Gordion want Athenian pottery? At the height of importation in the late 6th and early 5th centuries B.C. weren‚Äôt the Persians and Athenians archenemies?In this talk, I will also demonstrate how a misguided research question can lead to unexpected answers. The mistake, it turns out, was to assume that the consumers and users of imported Athenian pottery were the Persians. In fact, actual Persians probably had little interest ceramic pots, which they deemed far inferior to metal vessels. Instead, throughout the Persian world, the pattern is clear: consumption of imported Athenian pottery continues at sites that had already been importing Athenian pottery before the shift to Persian control. In other words, it is not the Persian newcomers using the Athenian pottery but the indigenous Anatolian cultures. Connecting themselves to the Greeks (if not the Athenians, specifically) signaled a desire to maintain their existing cultural identities, and perhaps, a little resistance to the Persians.SponsorsProgram in Archaeology, Department of ArchaeologyArchaeological Institute of America (AIA)",

Bade Museum Photo Archives 588N P.I. 1352Event DescriptionThe Bad√® Museum of Biblical Archaeology (Berkeley, California, USA) houses an archival collection of 12,000 documents and3,000 photographs. These records derive from archaeological excavations held over five seasons, from 1926-1935, led by William F. Bad√® at the site of Tell en-Na·π£beh (Ramallah, Palestine). Until recently, their use has been limited to addressing questions about archaeological methods and historical evidence to shed light on the ancient settlement. In 2021, museum curators began cataloging and reevaluating these archival sources, viewed through a new lens: as museum objects that are part of a continuous, multivariate assemblage alongside the archaeological artifacts housed at the museum, which were also produced by the original Mandate-era excavations at Tell en-Na·π£beh. Like the artifacts, the archives hold rich and complex histories of production, disposition, use, digitization, curation, interpretation, and exhibition. The archives range in format and modality, including analog and digitized image, film, and documentary records. They encompass photographic prints and negatives; hand-painted glass slides; nitrate film reels; hand-drawn illustrations, maps, plans, and object sketches; and hand- and typewritten documents covering a wide array of issues of daily life and excavation management. This paper will discuss the complex and varied life-histories of several key examples of different archival media to inform on questions about the dependent relationships between the archives and artifact collections. It will also explain the curatorial and archiving processes at the museum in the past and today, including new efforts to digitize, document, and curate these important records.SponsorsProgram in Archaeology, Department of Art & ArchaeologyArchaeological Institute of America (AIA)",

In these 40 texts, Foster reviews artists from Richard Hamilton and Jasper Johns to Gerhard Richter and Ed Ruscha; considers contemporaries from Louise Lawler and Cindy Sherman to Jeremy Deller and Adam Pendleton; and traces the development of criticism since the early 1960s, with essays on such influential figures as Susan Sontag and Rosalind Krauss and institutions likeArtforummagazine and the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program.Taking his title from Beckett‚Äî‚Äútry again, fail again, fail better‚Äù‚ÄîFoster notes that, etymologically, an essay is always an attempt, more or less failed. Critics fail artworks, because there can never be a definitive reading; art fails its historical moment, because it cannot resolve the contradictions that prompt it. But in these failures Foster finds historical consciousness, and with it the promise of future work, future illumination. In his ‚Äúreckonings‚Äù he turns his own long history of criticism to account, and succeeds in conveying shifting concepts of art and criticism, the work of key artists and critics, and the relationships between criticism, theory, history, and politics over the last six decades.Hal Fosteris the Townsend Martin Class of 1917 Professor of Art & Archaeology at Princeton University. He is the author ofWhat Comes After Farce?andBrutal Aesthetics, among other books. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he coeditsOctober,and writes regularly forThe London Review of Books.Jeff Dolventeaches poetry and poetics, especially of the English Renaissance. He has written three books of criticism,Scenes of Instruction(Chicago 2007),Senses of Style(Chicago 2018), and the admittedly hastyTake Care(Cabinet 2017), as well as essays on a variety of subjects, including Renaissance metrics, Edmund Spenser, Shakespeare‚Äôs reading, Fairfield Porter, and player pianos. His poems have appeared in magazines and journals in the US and the UK and in a volume,Speculative Music(Sarabande 2013). He is also an editor-at-large atCabinetmagazine, and was the founding director of Princeton‚Äôs Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in the Humanities (IHUM) and acting chair of the English Department in 2018-19.M+M strives to make everyone feel welcome.

Long on Friday April 14 at 4:30pmMachines between Learning and Practice in Early Modern EuropeIn this talk I focus on images of machines and the texts that accompanied them from the 1470s through the mid-sixteenth century. I compare the machine drawings of two contemporaries, the painter/architect/engineer Francesco di Giorgio and Francesco‚Äôs younger contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. Using Francesco‚ÄôsTrattatiand Leonardo‚Äôs Madrid Codex I, I explore both the practical and intellectual contexts of machine books and machine drawings. Examples include drawings of cranes, and of machine parts such as gears. ¬†Knowledge traditions include Pseudo-Aristotelian Mechanics, the medieval science of weights, and the influence of Vitruvius‚ÄôsDe architecturaand its Book X on machines. Practices include machines for constructing buildings such as cranes and machines for warfare. Traditions of text and image focusing on machines include sixteenth-century Vitruvian commentaries and the ‚ÄúTheaters of Machines,‚Äù by Jacques Besson and Agostino Ramelli. This talk will focus on the overlapping interests and multidisciplinary nature of the early modern fascination with machines.Open to the public and registration requested.SponsorDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyContactMo Chen[email¬†protected]",

Beyond merely acknowledging the geographical position of ancient Egypt on the African continent, the lecture examines the extent to which Egypt was of Africa culturally, first by scrutinizing the categories of ‚ÄòEgypt‚Äô and ‚ÄòNubia‚Äô and the connections between material and visual culture and identity. Subsequently it utilizes key artifacts in US collections as case studies to tell the story of this interaction anew, fleshing out the rich and complex rapport between Egypt and Nubia over the course of several millennia, from prehistory (ca. 3800 BCE) through pharaonic Meroe (350 CE). In the process, the lecture also highlights the importance as well as the limitations of using visual culture to articulate/construct and understand/read ancient identities.SponsorsProgram in Archaeology, Department of Art & ArchaeologyArchaeological Institute of America (AIA)",

Held in the second-floor gallery, this gathering will feature a shared dinner in a more convivial setting designed to encourage conversation and exchange.Practices of queer homemaking in displacement can act as resistance against hetero-patriarchal norms, thereby critiquing power structures, and committing to alternative modes of living. In conversation with historical and contemporary queer communes and individuals living in China, Italy, and the diaspora, our research documented memories, labor, and intangible layers of homemaking. Testing these strategies at a vacant villa of ETH Zurich, we transformed the institutional space into a domestic one by queering space and furniture. This talk will offer insight into both the research methodologies and the collective living practice, presented through a fiction book and a short film.soft resistance collectiveworks at the intersection of art and architecture. Through collective drawing, writing, filmmaking, and space-making, they frame the daily acts of displaced queer bodies as conscious homemaking strategies.

In his series of talks on 10th‚Äìcentury Chinese painting, Professor Wu demonstrates considerable methodological concern, empirical research, and macroscopic perspective, features which converge to provide solid case-studies, forefront issues, and a broad view of the transformation of Chinese painting from the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) to the Northern Song period (960‚Äì1127).‚Äù‚ÄúProfessor Wu first introduced newly discovered tomb paintings and their spatial signification within the architecture of¬†tombs and then integrated the archaeological material with existing ‚Äòmonuments‚Äô in Chinese painting history, offering a new way of looking at both tombs and paintings,‚Äù said Deputy Director of the¬†Tang Center for East Asian Art Dora Ching.¬†‚ÄúParticularly exciting was Professor Wu‚Äôs analysis of the relationship between the formats of landscape modes in the tombs and traditional hanging scrolls and handscrolls.

The near-simultaneous end of a twelve-year truce with the Dutch Republic, which resulted in the resumption of warfare, left no doubt that the royal project would require significant military efforts and strong leadership. Prominent artists of the time were enlisted by the crown to celebrate Philip's aptitude.

Beyond the city‚Äôs well-known monuments, however, lies a well of data that has barely begun to be tapped. This talk will introduce the research program of Tulane University‚Äôs Pompeii I.14 Project, an interdisciplinary excavation focusing on one large building complex on the southeastern edge of the city. Now in its fourth year, the project has begun to reveal the lives of the non-elite individuals‚Äîboth free and enslaved‚Äîwho lived and worked in the building. Among other findings, the results thus far indicate the agency of these people, who exploited the economic potential of the space by adopting a variety of profit-generating activities, which might have shifted with the seasons. The activity that likely occupied the winter season‚Äîthe manufacture of reed mats and baskets‚Äîwarrants particular interest. Our recovery of a large and complex reed-working workshop undermines Roman literary characterization of this industry as economically marginal, while the unique find of two rooms completely filled with piles of mineralized reeds complicates the traditional August date for the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius recorded by Pliny the Younger, as well as the fall dates that have been proposed based on archaeological data. Rather than advocating for (yet another!) eruption date, our team is now exploring how the incorporation of seasonal perspectives can bring new insights into life in Pompeii, both at the moment of the eruption and in the centuries preceding it.SponsorsDepartment of ClassicsDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyProgram in Archaeology",

The Mogao Caves, the largest Buddhist cave complex in the area, with nearly 500 cave temples filled with murals and sculpture, has inspired and will continue to inspire scholarship on an inexhaustible range of topics. During its period of activity, from the 4th to the 14th century, the Mogao Caves, often simply referred to as ‚ÄúDunhuang,‚Äù served as a center for Buddhism and a gateway for the movement of people, ideas, and goods between China and Central Asia.

Finding common ground in art and politics, Sundaram brought Msika to the Camden Poster Workshop, where Msika taught workshops, and where the two artists made anti-Apartheid posters that they pasted in Trafalgar Square in midnight guerrilla actions.Taking the friendship between Sundaram and Msika as a starting point, this paper focuses on the articulation of a transnational anti-colonial and anti-racist culture of visual protest that emerged across post-Imperial London and Paris during the ‚Äúlong ‚Äô68.‚Äù It looks at the Camden Poster Workshop and the Atelier Populaire along with other examples, and considers how these movements were connected and catalyzed through the activities of artists from the decolonizing world who spent time in both capitals.By linking the two cities and two empires to each other, and to larger networks of decolonial practice, this paper brings granularity to claims about the ‚Äúglobal 1968‚Äù and makes a case for the centrality of decolonization to its history. Rather than considering these cities as separate, yet parallel eruptions of political and cultural activity, I examine the histories of artists circulating between the two capitals, and consider the ways in which the transversal and networked geographies produced by these movements created discourses of intersecting structural critique and an aesthetics of visual protest, as embodied by the Atelier Populaire poster ‚Äú3 continents 1 r√©volution.‚ÄùSponsorDepartment of Art & Archaeology",

Detail. Handscroll; ink and color on silk. 25.9 √ó 376.5 cm. National Palace Museum, Taipei.Event DescriptionSeveral crucial archaeological excavations allow us to reach a fuller and more accurate assessment of the development of landscape painting during this period. With their precise provenance and dating, these finds help establish a new foundation for exploring issues of painting media, stylistic inventions, architectural context, and symbolism of landscape images, which were previously beyond the reach of traditional scholarship based on transmitted¬†examples.SummaryBy Kirstin OhrtProfessor Wu Hung of the University of Chicago presented three lectures for the Tang Center Lecture Series on the theme ‚ÄúRethinking the Tenth Century: A Pivotal Period in the History of Chinese Painting,‚Äù investigating first new methodologies and evidence, then figure painting, and finally landscape painting through a new lens.‚ÄúProfessor Wu has for decades been one of the most prolific, creative, generous, and impactful scholars in Chinese art history, as exemplified by his Tang Center lectures, which showed the path to rethinking¬†the tenth century in Chinese painting,‚Äù¬†said Director of the Tang Center for East Asian Art Professor Andrew Watsky.Since the 1990s, discoveries of tombs with stunning murals and mortuary objects have fundamentally changed our understanding of 10th‚Äìcentury Chinese painting. The archaeologically excavated materials have art historians reevaluating historical texts along with the handscrolls and hanging paintings which have been studied for decades.‚ÄúRarely in studies of Middle-Period Chinese art are scholars able to integrate recent archaeological findings of wall paintings with time-honored traditions mainly focused on scroll paintings,‚Äù said Professor Cheng-hua Wang. ‚ÄúProfessor Wu is one of the few who can do so and is perhaps even the only one. In his series of talks on 10th‚Äìcentury Chinese painting, Professor Wu demonstrates considerable methodological concern, empirical research, and macroscopic perspective, features which converge to provide solid case-studies, forefront issues, and a broad view of the transformation of Chinese painting from the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) to the Northern Song period (960‚Äì1127).‚Äù‚ÄúProfessor Wu first introduced newly discovered tomb paintings and their spatial signification within the architecture of¬†tombs and then integrated the archaeological material with existing ‚Äòmonuments‚Äô in Chinese painting history, offering a new way of looking at both tombs and paintings,‚Äù said Deputy Director of the¬†Tang Center for East Asian Art Dora Ching.¬†‚ÄúParticularly exciting was Professor Wu‚Äôs analysis of the relationship between the formats of landscape modes in the tombs and traditional hanging scrolls and handscrolls. For example, by analyzing the spatial layout and position of landscape murals in a tomb and then looking closely at the famous painting, the¬†TheDouble Screen, Wu reinterpreted the use and meaning of landscapes in the painting, compellingly demonstrating the creation of gendered space in the painting.‚ÄùThroughout the series, Wu built¬†on existing art history to find new ways to tell the story of Chinese 10th‚Äìcentury painting.Wu will expand these themes along with others into a book-length study that will be published by the Tang Center in association with Princeton University Press.SponsorsP.Y. and Kinmay W.

What is the role of seafaring ports in object mobility and in forming a Buddhist art different from that derived from the land routes of transmission? This lecture examines how the interwoven networks of ports and intermediaries facilitated the production and circulation of Buddhist artisanal crafts across the China Seas around the 10thto the 13thcenturies. It will show that an ever-increasing need to guide and protect ships at sea gave rise to new forms of art, while also endowing existing forms and symbols with new meanings. Moreover, the particulars of boats and ships dictated the sizes, scale, as well as the types of art and artifacts transported across the sea. Going beyond territorial boundaries, this ‚Äúmaritime Buddhist art‚Äù show features that refute the center-periphery model often applied to the history of East Asian Buddhist art.SponsorsDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyTang Center for East Asian Art",

Simpson International Building A71SpeakerJennifer RobertsAffiliationHarvard UniversityDetailsDetail of pastel rendering of the surface of Mars made at Jet Propulsion Laboratory from Mariner 4 flyby data, 1965. NASA/JPL-Caltech. Photo: Jack Madden.Event DescriptionIn 1965, NASA‚Äôs Mariner 4 probe executed its historic flyby of Mars, capturing the first images ever sent back to Earth from another planet. The numerical image data was transmitted to teletype machines at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, but it would take hours for the computers to convert the data into viewable television images. The engineers at JPL didn‚Äôt want to wait that long, so they stapled the strips to the wall, bought a box of pastels from a local art store, and rendered the image by hand, color-by-number style. It's hard to imagine an image more thoroughly beset by anachronism. A first glimpse of an alien world, enabled by advanced twentieth-century technology, comes into being in pastel‚Äîa medium most closely associated with eighteenth-century French portraiture. But perhaps this eccentric pastel drawing, in its very anachronism, can teach us to look anew at the project of visual representation both on- and off-Earth.SummaryBy Kirstin OhrtFrom left: Rachael DeLue and Jennifer Roberts (Photo/John Blazejewski)Jennifer Roberts took art history off the surface of the earth in the James F. Haley ‚Äô50 Memorial Lecture on Wednesday titled ‚ÄúThe Pastel from Mars.‚Äù Her subject was a pastel work completed by NASA engineers in 1965.¬†These unlikely artists were awaiting 25 renderings of the surface of Mars from the historic Mariner 4 probe space mission.¬†In the eight-and-one-half hours of suspense, while data transmitted from Mariner 4 was computed into images, these engineers printed and collaged together the binary code and brought about the first image of Mars in a color-by-number schematic. Though they had intended to use chalk, the clerk at the craft store up-sold them on Rembrandt color pastels given the gravity of the task‚Äîand so the image came into being in yellows, reds, oranges, and browns.Whereas the scientific community doesn‚Äôt assign the pastel work much importance (it recently made its way out of complete obscurity and into a stairwell), it was, in fact, the first image to be televised to the world. Given the impossibility of our seeing Mars, or any¬†extraterrestrial image, in the way that we see the world around us, Roberts suggests that pastel was the ideal medium for transmitting this image‚Äîsurpassing the misrepresentation as evidence of the computer‚Äôs rendering.¬†Pastel pigment hovers on paper in nebulous particles, imprecise and evanescent, reflecting a closer truth in the case of unseeable subject matter. Even its ingredients, ground marine fossils, align with the composition of Mars‚Äôs surface, which once held water.Addressing the possibility of past or existing life forms in space, Roberts pointed to the need for humanists to join scientists in their endeavor for discovery to forego the old frontier narratives of colonization and extraction. Rather than consider the pastel rendering frivolous per the scientific perspective, we should see it as foresighted and recognize the importance of giving humanists and art historians seats at the table.¬†Ultimately, the four impatient NASA engineers produced the ‚ÄúMarsiest‚Äù image possible in their haste, long before the computer produced its misleadingly lifeless space-scapes; according to Roberts, ‚ÄúNASA got it right on the first try.‚ÄùJennifer Roberts gestures to the pastel rendering of Mars (Photo/John Blazejewski)SponsorDepartment of Art & Archaeology",

For many of his contemporaries (as well as later generations), Rubens, with his multiple roles in the world of art and diplomacy, embodied the versatile persona frequently associated with the age of the Baroque, its scientific discoveries, colonial conquests, religious wars, and aesthetic and technological experimentation, but also growing skepticism about the reliability of authoritative claims.This one-day workshop brings together a group of scholars from both academia and museums to consider new and old perspectives for approaching and understanding this key figure of seventeenth-century European art. Rather than aiming for definitive answers, this workshop is designed to provide a forum for discussion to generate and test approaches to writing about or exhibiting Rubens‚Äôs works, and the ways in which they themselves engage with an ever-expanding world and its different cultures of knowledge and material expertise.SummarySponsorDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyContactMo Chen[email¬†protected]",

Watkins,Nugget of Gold 201 40/100 Ounces‚ÄîSpanish Dry Diggings, El Dorado Co., Cal.,1866-67, albumen print on paper, 14 11/16 x 19 ¬æ in (37.3 x 50.2 cm). Hearst Mining Collection of Views by C. E. Watkins, 1871-1876, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley.Event DescriptionA close reading of Carleton Watkins‚ÄôsNugget of Gold‚Äîattending to its subject matter, production, world fair display, reproduction and circulation, and especially its minerality‚Äîreveals a profound identification in late-nineteenth-century US-American society between photography and mining. Representing a fusion of nature and culture, photography has been likened to currency almost from its inception. Yet the material and specifically mineral limitations of this economy have been overlooked, though they establish a direct parallel with another gold-dependent commodity: money. Both were historically curtailed by their analog quality; their proliferation, and hence their value, is limited by extractive labor and material substance.SummaryBy Kirstin OhrtProfessor Monica Bravo delivered the 2024 Reunions lecture ‚ÄúMineral Analogs: Carleton Watkins‚Äôs Photographs and the Gold Standard‚Äù on Friday, May 24, to a crowded lecture hall. Bravo drew from her current book projectSilver Pacific: A Mineral History of Early American Photographywhich explores the source of 19th-century photography‚Äôs raw materials, the research for which has earned her the prestigious 2024National Endowment for the¬†Humanities¬†(NEH) grant(Link opens in new window). Focusing on the works of photographer Carleton E. Watkins, Bravo‚Äôs impressively cross-disciplinary lecture connected art history to geology, chemistry, sociology, economic history, numismatics and computer science.Bravo opened her lecture with the image of Watkins‚ÄôsNugget of Gold, which captures the organic form of a raw gold nugget atop its acculturated form: three gold bars.‚ÄúThe work entailed by such a transformation occurs out of frame, yet the quiet juxtaposition of raw material and commodity form teaches viewers to make equivalences between mineral and money,‚Äù said Bravo. The photograph‚Äôs exhibition in the ParisExposition Universelleof 1867 helped establish an association between photography, mining and the American West.The connection between minerals and photography was, in fact, innate‚Äîembedded in the very make-up of photographs. ¬†Mercury vapor, silver crystals and gold chloride toner were among substances used in late-19th-century photography; and Watkins coated hisNugget of Gold‚Äîwith gold.Bravo extended the comparison of photography with currency beyond the concepts of circulation andvaluation within a closed system, identifying the intrinsic commonality of the mineral content of both. With its production potential hinged, like currency, to the availability of mineral resources, Bravo identified the analog nature of 19th-century photography. ¬†‚ÄúWatkins‚ÄôsNugget of Goldinaugurates the conception of analog photography as materially-bound, though it took the emergence of digital technology to retrospectively draw it into relief,‚Äù said Bravo.Connecting the trajectory of photography‚Äôs evolution from its mineral roots to the present, Bravo concluded ‚ÄúToday, artificial intelligence technologies like DALL-E and other so-called deep learning models create the ultimate conditions of alienated labor, as its technology scrapes the web for images on which to train its algorithms.‚Äù‚ÄúTreating photographs as natural resources,‚Äù Bravo continued, ‚Äúthis constitutive feature continues to ignore the labor of photographers and their authorship, once again identifying mining‚Äînow, the language used is ‚Äòdata-mining‚Äô‚Äîwith the medium.‚ÄùSponsorDepartment of Art & Archaeology",

EistererTuesday, September 9, 2025 @5pm ETN 107 (School of Architecture)Furnishing Fascism: Modernist Design and Politics in Italy¬†discusses how seemingly neutral household items and the allegedly minor arts‚Äîmost notably interior design‚Äîplayed a critical role in shaping Italy's exclusionary sense of national identity and enacting fascist politics. As the unification of the country and its modernization disrupted regional styles and modes of life across the peninsula, modernist architects and designers responded to the increasingly eclectic nature of architectural interiors by pursuing new forms of order and cohesion that operated on the scale of the family home while contributing to shape the nation as a homeland. Interweaving design theory, architectural history, and media scholarship, the book reveals the political entanglement of modernism in early twentieth-century Italy and explores the complexities of cultural production under authoritarian power.Ignacio G.

But observers and gazetteers suggest a wider color palette began to be offered to a range of consumers in the early Qing, with new dyeing techniques being applied to both silk and cotton.¬†An expansion of clothing colors for ordinary people is intriguing to consider in light of¬†claims that the living standards of inhabitants of the wealthiest parts of China compared favorably to those of Europe in this period. But while material culture history might be supposed to hold some potential for substantiating these claims outside cliometrics,¬†the biases of collecting and material survival mean that extant cotton garments are rare: though¬†the vast majority of Qing Chinese would have worn cotton or hemp, studies of Qing dress are dominated by silk.¬†Accordingly,The Cloth Classic(BujingÂ∏ÉÁªè), an early nineteenth-century compendium of advice and experience written by a cloth merchant for cloth merchants, possesses considerable value for understanding the causes and impact of advances in cotton dyeing. This talk positionsThe Cloth Classicwithin the context of developments in the Jiangnan cotton industry, with a focus on the growing dyeing sector, and evaluates the factors driving its expansion, including dyeing innovations, dyestuff¬†trade,¬†commercial organization, and consumer demand. By so doing, this understudied work redresses the unrepresentative material archive to provide insight into the economic and cultural significance of the cotton industry‚Äôs finishing¬†sector.SponsorsP.Y. and Kinmay W.

In revisiting and rethinking the story of this luminous and much fetishized metal, Morris elaborates a theory of technofetishism, through which the separation of gold from rock became alibi for racial separatism, and the origin of a toxic extractivism whose effects can be seen everywhere today.Rosalind C.

While most of the site‚Äôs remains were related to a third-century BCE occupation linked to gold extraction in the nearby mountains, adjacent to this older settlement the team discovered and fully excavated a small but very well-preserved Roman military fortress, called Berkou in the ancient texts found at the site. Only occupied for a few decades, the fortress offers a snapshot of military life during the height of early Imperial expansion into this remote region, and provides a valuable glimpse of military supply and organization during the Flavian era.SponsorsProgram in Archaeology, Department of Art & ArchaeologyArchaeological Institute of America (AIA)",

But a peculiar subset of perspectival views, charting recession along the vertical axis perpendicular to the direction of vision, seems to promise nothing less than a litmus test to distinguish the seer from the seen, subject from object: and that without metaphysics. Flowering in the 19th century under the revolutionary influence of photography, vertical recession died prematurely at the hands of a powerful nemesis, John Ruskin, only to revive zombie-like in the modernist aesthetics of Paul Klee and Nelson Goodman, who seized upon it as evidence that all perspective in art is arbitrary. Setting aside this fallacy, I emphasize the embodied, first-person character of most uses of vertical recession, from its unobtrusive roots in caricature to its contemporary prominence in motion pictures and electronic games.SponsorDepartment of Art & Archaeology",

The rich deposit of elaborately decorated frescoes discovered within it gave the building the name of ‚ÄòHouse of the Frescoes‚Äô. Several things are odd about this structure: its architecture without obvious parallels in Crete; the quantity of frescoes strangely stacked in layers at the end of a room; the aggressive dismantling of the building after its abandonment which destroyed floors and walls; the surprising perfect preservation of two of his rooms, seemingly untouched by the dismantling. What happened in there? Who took off and stacked the frescoes? Who was destroying the building? Who did not dare to touch those two rooms and why? Why did the House of the Frescoes deserve such a treatment? In this lecture, I explore the evidence to reconstruct the final moments in the life and afterlife of this intriguing little building.",

These moves were crucial both symbolically and technically, as together they sparked what would become a veritable radio war between the Eastern and Western blocs during the Cold War. In this talk, I will presentRadio-Activities, my recently published book, in which I investigate this spatial conflict by interrogating the political, technological, and environmental dimensions of architecture at a time when buildings began to interact with the remote transmission of information. By its very nature, the medium of radio promised to evaporate the intrinsic material aspect of architecture; in fact, it did no such thing. By way of transscalar analyses, in the book, I pay particular attention to Berlin‚Äôs buildings, walls, transmission towers, factories, research institutions, and territorial organisations during the Cold War period, which enabled the production, reproduction, and transmission of sonic-based content across the divide of the Iron Curtain. In doing I reveal underresearched continuities between politics, technology, media, and architecture, reframing notions of national and transnational boundaries. InRadio-ActivitiesI interrogate the status and agency of buildings during a period ‚Äî not unlike today‚Äôs ‚Äî of increasingly hyperconnected, ubiquitous, and apparently invisible modes of coexistence.Alfredo Thiermannis an architect and Assistant Professor for History and Theory of Architecture at the √âcole polytechnique f√©d√©rale in Lausanne.

The results of the past and current excavations at the site by the Archaeological Society of Athens and of the intensive urban survey conducted in the 2000s revealed clear traces of landscaping and remains of impressive monuments that betray the dynastic aspirations of Demetrios, and his desire to put a Macedonian stamp on the new city.Please RSVP Here.

Many of the cities named have Bronze Age remains, verified through archaeology, while other places may be mere memories or fantasies of the past. North of Thessaly, both names and tales peter out, but recent archaeological field work and historical research seek to expand the Mycenaean world into the north Aegean, in mythology and reality. Excavations conducted at Methone in Pieria since 2003 have revealed the long and rich local histories of human activity in northern Greece, from the Bronze Age through Early Iron Age Greek colonization and the growth of Macedon.SponsorsProgram in Archaeology, Department of Art & ArchaeologyArchaeological Institute of America (AIA)",

But these inequities did not happen overnight; in places like southeastern Europe they emerged over the course of thousands of years as the small egalitarian farming villages of the Neolithic gave way to some of the earliest hierarchical kingdoms in the Iron Age. This is the story that is told in the First Kings of Europe exhibition, an ambitious international collaboration between twenty-six museums in eleven countries in southeastern Europe. The exhibition, organized by the Field Museum of Natural History, is currently on display in Chicago before it travels to Ottawa, Canada, in early 2024. In this presentation, Bill Parkinson gives an overview of the exhibition he co-curates with his colleagues, Attila Gyucha, and discusses the challenges they faced during the process of putting it together over the last eight years.SummaryBy Kirstin OhrtWilliam Parkinson outlined the eight-year journey it took to pull together The First Kings of Europe exhibition now on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. His partnership with Attila Gyucha in Hungary along with collaborators across the Balkan Peninsula brought the show to fruition despite the dramatic setback that COVID inflicted.Parkinson first set the stage by discussing the strengths and shortcomings of his prior exhibitions at the Field Museum. From these, he arrived at the most effective model for drawing a curious audience and leaving them with a lasting impression.For The First Kings of Europe, Parkinson and his team gathered more than 700 objects from 26 museums in 11 countries. A replica of the most recently commissioned crown in Europe, worn by Queen Maria of Romania, and an ancient Thracian gold wreath bookend the exhibition - signaling to viewers the royalty whose ascension from a prior period of agrarian egalitarianism was the focus of the exhibit. Among installations in the exhibition is a diorama of a Hungarian village dating back to 5000 B.C.E. as well as gold objects from Varna, Bulgaria, that date back 1000 years more. Another compelling exhibit projects flames to give the impression of a burning funeral pyre. The cross-section of captivating objects was selected to reinforce one central theme: that today‚Äôs predicament, in which the eight wealthiest people hold the wealth of half the world, is the culmination of a trajectory with ancient roots.William Parkinson presents The First Kings of Europe to an audience of undergraduate and graduate students along with faculty, staff, and community members (Photo/Kirstin Ohrt)SponsorsArchaeological Institute of America (AIA)Program in Archaeology, Department of Art & Archaeology",

The practices and processes of everyday life, which have left less noticeable traces, can be harder to access, even though it is these ordinary and mundane acts that can profoundly increase our understanding of life before modernity. Building on Bourdieu‚Äôs thesis that habitus informs practical action and Wittgenstein‚Äôs emphasis on the need to ground human experience in everyday language, this graduate conference asks how our understanding of pre-modern societies and cultures changes if we remain faithful to what sources tell us of practices ‚Äúon the ground.‚Äù As such, this conference focuses on the lived lives of ordinary people‚Äîamong others, laborers, artisans, and lower clergy. We‚Äôll¬†explore themes of liminality and intersectionality, practicality and processes, customs and traditions, and more as they relate to the quotidian in the late antique and medieval world. How did the individual perceive and navigate the world around them? What is the nitty-gritty of everyday pre-modern life, and how do we know?For questions, contact conference organizers Alice Morandy (amorandy@princeton.edu) or Lucia Waldschuetz (lucia.waldschuetz@princeton.edu).This conference is sponsored by the Program in Medieval Studies, the Center for Collaborative History, the Committee for the Study of Late Antiquity, the Program in the Ancient World, and the Departments of Art & Archaeology and Religion.Full event details",

During this 1-day colloquium, we will examine themes of cultural pluralism, religious hegemonies, and enduring ideological boundaries across the Atlantic and Mediterranean worlds. We are looking to gather a wide range of professors and graduate students to reflect on and explore the enduring effects of Muslim-ruled Iberia in material culture, religion, language, literature, legal writings‚Äîfrom libraries to food to clothing to art in the Early Modern period and beyond. We are interested in discussing these traces across a variety of media, time periods, and geographies, with questions such as (though not limited to) the following: How do we read the imperial Spanish impulse to eliminate but at the same time rewrite and reclaim its Islamic roots? Where are themoriscavoices in colonial Latin America and in the Philippines?

Buildings based on fear of bacteria, which is to say fear of life itself, must give way to buildings learning from models of coexistence based on bacteria themselves. Colomina and Wigley draw on the latest research into microbes to rethink the past and possible futures of the built environment.We the Bacteriaexplores the intimate entanglements of the microbes within bodies and buildings over the last 10,000 years, culminating in the antibiotic philosophy of contemporary architecture.Beatriz Colominais the Howard Crosby Butler Professor of the History of Architecture and the founding director of the Media and Modernity program at Princeton University.

Ingo Niermann argues that, stirred by rapid developments in automation and AI, these manifold crises are about to culminate in a new paradigm of self-sufficiency‚Äîmonadism‚Äîthat overturns the liberal era and forces a reinvention of all social parameters.¬†To interact safely with consent and care, monads tend to segregate in communities of like-minded people‚Äîvoluntary tribes.Even when living as crowded urbanites, monads avoid the implicit violence of random encounters.Ingo Niermannis a writer and the editor of the speculative book seriesSolution(Sternberg Press).Recently published books includeThe Monadic Age: Notes on the Coming Social Order(2024)¬†andSolution 295-304: Mare Amoris(2020).

In Latin America, the Day of the Dead is a family-centered celebration, where homes and graves are prepared to honor ancestors and family who have departed and their favorite foods and drink are offered. In the United States, the holiday has also become a cultural and artistic experience, where altar exhibitions and making, processions, and vigils are often accompanied by political messages to point to injustices that have caused unnecessary deaths.

Are there contemporary works that offer new perspectives on the history of the Cold War or its fallout? Which objects have informed politics of care and solidarity? For this informal lunch workshop, we request participants to share something that responds to these questions. Participants will have the opportunity to briefly introduce the object, if desired, but the goal is to spark unplanned conversation, building a collective set of academic interests in expectation of the more formal events to follow. This will be a forum for interrogating how the themes of the conference are resonant in contemporary art and politics.We will spend just a few minutes on each object, contingent on how many are circulated.

Building on the transnational solidarities and revolutionary movements discussed throughout the conference, the objects selected are designed to prompt new conversations and questions. The reserved materials include poetry written by L√©opold Senghor, Black Panther Party ephemera, the Tricontinental,¬† East German children‚Äôs books, and revolutionary posters, among other items. This is also an opportunity to think collectively about the legacy of these materials, activating the wealth of area knowledge in the room through engaging with texts in Korean, French, German, Russian, Spanish, and English.As the viewing area is limited, there is unfortunately only room for 15 people to sign up for this opportunity.

Meiselas returned ten years later to find the people in her photographs for the filmPictures from a Revolution. On the 25th¬†anniversary of the revolution, she brought nineteen murals of her photographs back to the landscapes where they were made, to collaborate with local communities and create sites of collective memory. Meiselas will reflect on her work and the various forms it has taken, including tracing the lives of her images as they have circulated and been repatriated, shifting their meaning over time.This event is co-sponsored by thePrinceton University Art Museum.Susan Meiselasis a documentary photographer based in New York.

(1599-1600). Contarelli Chapel, painting:The Calling of St. Matthew, Larger Entity: S. Luigi dei Francesi, detail: left portion. [Oil painting, Figures (representations)]Event DescriptionRepresentations of architecture on Roman coins have long been studied by scholars interested in retrieving information about ancient monuments, especially those ones that are partially or totally lost. Recent scholarship has shown that numismatic images cannot be treated as straightforward and objective sources about the appearance of these monuments. However, they remain a significant witness of the reception of such buildings. In other words, they can give us an idea of how a temple or an arch were viewed, or were supposed to be viewed‚Äîwhich aspects of their architecture, which details of their decoration were deemed important and worthy of special focus. The talk will address the methodological implications of this approach with the help of selected cases. In particular, it will argue that we need to achieve an adequate understanding of the dynamics of attention in order properly to appreciate the way in which architectural images on coins functioned in antiquity.SponsorsProgram in Archaeology, Department of Art & ArchaeologyArchaeological Institute of America (AIA), Thompson Lecture",

Gift of George D. and Margo Behrakis, MFA Boston 2006.848Event DescriptionSummaryBy Kirstin OhrtChristine Kondoleon, George Behrakis Chair of the Art of Ancient Greece and Rome at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, delivered this year‚Äôs Kurt Weitzmann lecture: ‚ÄúTo put back all the things people cluttered up...To Straighten, like a diligent Housekeeper of Reality...‚Äù¬†Having completed 12 new galleries featuring Greek, Roman, and Byzantine objects, Kondoleon, discussed the priorities, considerations, and challenges that framed her task.¬†Above all, Kondoleon sought to find new ways to engage with an increasingly diverse audience through various approaches to storytelling.Kondoleon noted that she gave her first scholarly lecture at Princeton in 1978 in the presence of Kurt Weitzmann, for whom the lecture is named. And she drew her lecture‚Äôs title from the 1914 poem Keeper of Sheep by Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa, which mirrors the perception of the curator as the keeper of objects to be preserved, but not necessarily engaged with. Her own intention in designing these new galleries was to actively welcome viewers of varied backgrounds and knowledge levels.A variety of tools facilitated this endeavor.¬†Screen summaries provide engaging background information, for example, videos help viewers visualize the original vibrant color covering ancient sculptures, and interviews with everyday people make the objects more relatable.¬†To change the physical experience of the gallery space, Kondoleon went as far as raising the roof to add more light and reflect ancient architecture. She installed large screens as backdrops that show footage of an ancient site with the fluttering of leaves reinforced by the sound of a Mediterranean breeze to transport the viewer. Viewers are encouraged to sample the sounds of prayers in Greek or choose from a group of Byzantine hymns. Displays of modern-day artists alongside those from antiquity are another bridge to the past, exemplified by Kondoleon‚Äôs Cy Twombly exhibition Making Past Present, a concept Kondoleon intends to reiterate.Among the 12 new galleries, the Daily Life Gallery displays over 300 toys, crafts, sports, farming, and medicinal objects. These artifacts, like wine cups that reveal a surprise image once emptied, create a shared experience with the ancients, a timeless inside joke, representing precisely the sort of relatable, relevant storytelling Kondoleon is aiming for.‚ÄúChoosing which stories to tell was one of the most exciting parts of the reinstallation project,‚Äù said Kondoleon.¬†‚ÄúAt the same time, we realize the importance of making space for visitors to find their own stories‚Äîto connect in their own ways.‚ÄùFrom left: Pamela Patton, Beatrice Kitzinger, Christine Kondoleon, and Charlie Barber (Photo/John Blazejewski)SponsorsDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyIndex of Medieval Art",

ChaudharyParanoid Publics: Psychopolitics of Truthresponse by Ben C. BaerTuesday, November 11, 2025 @5pm ETN 107 (School of Architecture)Facts and established truths are regularly denied in contemporary life. This situation has brought paranoid politics into the mainstream, from conspiracy theories like QAnon, to sex panics and assaults on public health measures, to election denialism and the rise of vigilante militias.Paranoid Publicsanalyzes these phenomena as psychosocial realities enmeshed with emerging ways of determining truth. Today‚Äôs paranoia cannot simply be blamed on the rise of social media or the recent surge of populist anger. Rather, as Chaudhary shows, both are fueled by preexisting psychosocial processes. Applying psychodynamics to analyze truth and politics,Paranoid Publicsforegrounds unconscious demands, wishes, and compulsions. Against the hope that progressive economic policies might dispel widespread disorientation and disillusionment, Chaudhary reveals how psychic realities mark politics as deeply as do self-interest and class dynamics. Making a case for psychosocial understandings of our current historical juncture,Paranoid Publicsradically expands our notion of the political.Zahid R. Chaudharyis an Associate Professor of English at Princeton University. He specializes in postcolonial studies, visual culture, and critical theory. His first book,Afterimage of Empire: Photography in Nineteenth-Century India,provides a historical and philosophical account of early photography in India, analyzing how aesthetic experiments in colonial photographic practice shed light on the changing nature of perception and notions of truth, memory, and embodiment.

His teaching, research, and writing focus on problems of representation, language, idiom, and translation; the politics of culture and cultural politics; historical and contemporary modes and situations of subalternity; differentiated patterns of modern imperialism and colonialism; Marxism in an international framework; epistemic change and intellectual labor; theories and practices of education. The parts of the world he works on are pockets of South Asia, Europe, the Caribbean and Africa; and the limits of his scholarship confine him mainly, but not exclusively, to modern and contemporary conjunctures. He has learned from and continues to try and teach several genres of literary writings, Marxist theory, deconstruction, and postcolonial theory.

Building on or dismantling such historical divisions as Western/Eastern Roman Empire, Latin/Orthodox, or simply East/West, speakers will explore what ‚ÄúEast‚Äù and ‚ÄúEast Christian‚Äù mean, how the boundaries of these concepts changed over time, and where exactly are the edges of the geographic, political, and religious ‚ÄúEast.‚Äù This conference will offer a new understanding of the eastern Christian world by examining its cultural production in its own right and demonstrating that its rich, complex, and significant artistic production was not at the periphery of somewhere else, but rather at the center of an interconnected world.The conference will focus on the regions of medieval Syria, the Caucasus, and Eastern Europe. These territories are often neglected in medieval and early modern scholarship as regions that are merely ‚ÄúEast‚Äù of somewhere more important. The material culture produced in the regions ‚Äúeast‚Äù of Western Europe‚Äîsuch as modern-day Ukraine, Serbia or Romania, to mention only a few‚Äîhas for a long time been considered of ‚Äúlesser‚Äù value or importance compared to France or Italy; the Caucasus is often considered only in relation to Byzantium; and art produced in Armenia, Georgia and Anatolia has often been discussed in terms of a center/periphery dichotomy. Rarely is the visual production of these areas allowed to speak for itself.SummarySponsorsIndex of Medieval Art, Department of Art & ArchaeologyDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyPrinceton Institute for International and Regional Studies (PIIRS)The Seeger Center for Hellenic Studies, with the support of The Erric B.

With the help of multispectral photography and imaging techniques, the surviving traces - often ornaments and pattern - are being documented. These images, which are mostly taken of individual small areas of the sculpture, are analyzed producing elaborate drawings. The resulting findings are then transferred to three-dimensional and original-sized casts or 3D prints.This process gives rise to new questions that need to be clarified through further examination of the original and by searching for comparanda in ancient art history.It is only through the practice of physical and three-dimensional reconstruction that this research approach achieves its best possible results.In the meantime, more than sixty reconstructions have been created, which also serve worldwide as a medium to communicate the little-known and irritating fact of painted ancient sculpture to a wider audience.SponsorProgram in Archaeology, Department of Art & Archaeology",

Princeton University Art Museum, x1983-447Event DescriptionMany people know the name of Belle da Costa Greene, if not also her story as the fledgling librarian who rose to become librarian and then director of the famous Morgan Library & Museum in New York (1905‚Äì1948). A major exhibition opening this fall at the Morgan will explore the broad scope of Greene‚Äôs life and career, including the challenges she faced as a young woman of African-American heritage who lived as white in a field dominated by powerful European and American men. But where did Greene acquire the training in languages, history, and rare book studies that would support her success? With the support of the Princeton Histories Fund, a team of researchers from the Princeton University Library and the Index of Medieval Art set out to learn more. Their findings include the discovery of Greene‚Äôs hand in library records, a letter pinpointing the beginning of her work with the Morgan in summer 1905, and a fascinating correspondence documenting her continuing professional relationship with Princeton faculty and staff after her departure for New York.These findings will be highlighted in a mini-exhibition opening on November 12, 2024 at Firestone Library and beginning with a round table discussing the project‚Äôs findings and their ramifications for Greene‚Äôs biography and the history of librarianship. Featured participants will include Kathleen Brennan of Princeton‚Äôs Mudd Library; Erica Ciallela of the Morgan Library & Museum and Schlesinger Library, Harvard University; and Mireille Djenno of Firestone Special Collections. The round table will be held at 4:30 pm on Nov. 12 in the Chancellor Green Rotunda, the very building in which the university‚Äôs library was housed during Greene‚Äôs time at Princeton.

He makes films and video installations that read African American historiography through the poetics and aesthetics of experimental cinema. Often drawing on archival sounds and images, his work features staged re-enactments, hand-cranked cameras, rear-projection, close-focus cinematography, re-photography, photochemical manipulations, and screen captured video, among other strategies. Working through incongruity and slippages, between sound and image, between past, present and future, and between absence and presence, his films, like the music from which they take inspiration, embody the existential complexities and paradoxes of racialized identity in the U.S.M+M strives to make everyone feel welcome.

Cheng]Tuesday, November 19, 2024 @5pm ETN107 (School of Architecture)What would it mean to treat an interval of space as a line, thus drawing an empty void into a constellation of art and meaning-laden things? In this presentation, Irene V. Small discusses her new book, which elucidates the signal discovery of the Brazilian artist Lygia Clark in 1954: a fissure of space Clark called ‚Äúthe organic line.‚Äù A cavity that binds discrepant entities together, the organic line transforms planes into flexible topologies, borders into membranes, and interstices into points of connection. The presentation will focus on Clark‚Äôs architectural experiments and their implications for conceptualizing subjectivity, space, and networks.Irene V.

After carefully considering texts and the traditions of the Church, they confirmed the long-attested view that the Incarnation (the pivotal Christian doctrine that God took on human form in Jesus Christ) legitimizes images. They also established that images should neither be worshiped nor destroyed. In fact, images could be used to instruct people about religion and morals and to elevate the mind to spiritual things. In this lecture I shall limit myself to considering the presence of high-relief and three-dimensional images in repouss√© metalwork or other media in western churches before and after the Paris Synod, in the period of the image controversy (c.720s‚Äì850). Generally lost, high-relief and three-dimensional images are recorded in written sources.High-relief and three-dimensional images from Rome, Gaul/Francia, England, and Langobardia have occasionally been mentioned in studies on early medieval art, either to retrace the re-birth of three-dimensional statuary or to discuss image worship. They have also been occasionally construed as attestations of iconophilia, that is an attitude in favor of sacred images. Whether this kind of image might have functioned as an ideological statement should be evaluated not only by considering the specific circumstances in which they were situated, but also the broader body of evidence offered by written sources and material culture between the fourth and the ninth centuries in various regions of the West. I set out to do this in my paper.SponsorsDepartment of Art & ArchaeologyIndex of Medieval Art",

Such a practice of comparison aims to claim the figure of the amateur as a model to counter the cult of expertise and academic professionalism. Drawing on Edward Said‚Äôs brief discussion of the notion of ‚Äúamateurism‚Äù in his 1993 Reith Lectures as an antidote to the challenges of professionalism that undermine ‚Äúthe intellectual‚Äôs ingenuity and will,‚Äù the talk first offers a brief history of the standardization of comparative literature as a discipline in postwar America, underscoring its disciplinary anxiety and obsession with a professional identity. It then elaborates how such an attitude, reasonable though it may seem, given the existential threats to the humanities in the academy since the emergence of Reaganomics and neoliberalism, has had its pitfalls, including what David Damrosch has astutely described as the predicaments of ‚Äúscholarly tourism‚Äù and ‚Äúliterary jet-setting.‚Äù",

Read his fullbio here.Abstract for Professor Cole‚Äôs lectures:Progressives have increasingly lost faith in the First Amendment‚Äîat least as it has been interpreted and applied by the Supreme Court.¬† They argue that free speech has been ‚Äúweaponized‚Äù by big business as a deregulatory tool; that hate speech inflicts harms that warrant its regulation; that free speech is obsolete in the internet age; and that it subjects campaign finance regulation to unjustified judicial scrutiny.¬† Each of these criticisms is widely shared in the legal academy, often taken as given.These lectures will offer a defense of the First Amendment from its progressive critics. I am a progressive myself.¬† But I will argue that the progressive case against the First Amendment, while offering important insights, is not just unpersuasive, but counterproductive.¬† I seek to offer in short, a progressive defense to the progressive critics of free speech today.Commentators:Two commentators follow each lecture (all commentators are with us both days):Ulrich Baer, University Professor, Departments of German and Comparative Literature, Faculty of Arts & Science; Director, Center for the Humanities, New York University;Joshua Cohen, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Department of Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley;Catharine A.

Mitchell Professor in Law and Public Policy and former National Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Read his fullbio here.Abstract for Professor Cole‚Äôs lectures:Progressives have increasingly lost faith in the First Amendment‚Äîat least as it has been interpreted and applied by the Supreme Court.¬† They argue that free speech has been ‚Äúweaponized‚Äù by big business as a deregulatory tool; that hate speech inflicts harms that warrant its regulation; that free speech is obsolete in the internet age; and that it subjects campaign finance regulation to unjustified judicial scrutiny.¬† Each of these criticisms is widely shared in the legal academy, often taken as given.These lectures will offer a defense of the First Amendment from its progressive critics. I am a progressive myself.¬† But I will argue that the progressive case against the First Amendment, while offering important insights, is not just unpersuasive, but counterproductive.¬† I seek to offer in short, a progressive defense to the progressive critics of free speech today.Commentators:Two commentators follow each lecture (all commentators are with us both days):Ulrich Baer, University Professor, Departments of German and Comparative Literature, Faculty of Arts & Science; Director, Center for the Humanities, New York University;Joshua Cohen, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Department of Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley;Catharine A.

Although this ideal image might have been appealing, as reflected in the existing literature, it does not explain how the Umayyad fiscal system was established and operated in the frontier region of Khurasan. By conducting a systematic analysis of Arabic and non-Arabic documentary and literary sources, this presentation will demonstrate that Umayyad taxation in Khurasan was closely linked to the dynamic processes of conquests in Khurasan and was constantly changed according to local needs.Said Reza¬†Huseini is a historian specialising in Indo-Persian and Islamic history in the connected regions of Khurasan and North India over thelongue dureÃÅe, from Late Antiquity to the Early Modern era. His research is based on a wide range of documentary and literary sources in Persian, Middle Persian, Bactrian, Sogdian and Arabic. He¬†takes a connected historical approach to understanding these milieus, uncovering long-term patterns of intellectual and cultural change and exchange.¬†He has published various articles on the socio-political situation in late antique Bactria, cross-communal interactions, the fiscal system, slavery, rebellions in early Islamic Khurasan, and Neoplatonic kingship in Ilkhanid Iran and Mughal India. His first book, entitledThe Arab Conquests of Bactria: Local Power Politics and Arab Domination (651‚Äì750 CE)¬†will be published by Edinburgh University Press next year. Besides, he is also writing a newmonograph,The Mongols in Persian Discourse: Continuity and Changes 1252-1582, that will be published by a university press.Reza graduated from JNU, New Delhi, where he studied the history of Medieval Central Asia and¬†Early Modern India. He continued his research at Leiden University and completed his PhD dissertation on the Arab Muslim Conquests in Bactria. He also worked as part of the Silk Roads Programme at King‚Äôs College, Cambridge. He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University and teaches a course on the connected history of Central Asia.SponsorsDepartment of Near Eastern StudiesNear Eastern Studies ProgramContributions to and/or sponsorship of any event does not constitute departmental or institutional endorsement of the specific program, speakers or views presented",

This is nowhere clearer than in the struggle over Palestine. And at no point starker than in the ongoing genocide in Gaza. In this talk, I take as my primary object the Palestinian refugee camps created in the fallout of the eliminatory violence of Israel‚Äôs founding to show how these camps become the main place where settler colonial attempts to dominate space and time encounter Indigenous refusal. Seen from the camps, Israel becomes a settler colonial project defined by its inability to move past the past‚Äîa project stuck at its foundational moment of conquest. At the same time, the Palestinian insistence on return is a refusal to abide by the closure of the past into settler futurity. Palestinian struggle does not just happen in the open time of dispossession; it happens over this time. This struggle is a form of anticolonial refusal that draws its power not from any decisive finality, but precisely from irresolution and keeping time open.Nasser Abourahme is a writer and teacher, and currently assistant professor at Bowdoin College. He works broadly between colonial history and political theory, and his writing can be found in places like Critical Times, Radical Philosophy, Cultural Critique, and Critical Ethnic Studies. He‚Äôs the author of The Time beneath the Concrete: Palestine between Camp and Colony (Duke University Press, 2025).SponsorsDepartment of Near Eastern StudiesPrinceton Institute for International and Regional StudiesContributions to and/or sponsorship of any event does not constitute departmental or institutional endorsement of the specific program, speakers or views presented.Related documentsEvent Flyer",

The scope of this theory far exceeds what current scholarship has thus far revealed.¬†In this talk, I demonstrate the multiple layers of Zhu‚Äôs engagement with emotions, showing that he was concerned not only with shaping feelings through moral structures, but also with a set of issues potentially associated with ethically appropriate emotions. The various dimensions of Zhu‚Äôs theory converge to show that his moral psychology is grounded in an expansive ontology of emotions that integrates cosmological, medical, and moral-philosophical ideas typically siloed in modern scholarship.Ya Zuois an associate professor of History at University of California, Santa Barbara.

      "description": "DateOct 8, 2025,4:30 pm‚Äì6:00 pmLocation202 Jones HallSpeakerJohn AleknaAffiliationPeking University (Beijing, China)DetailsEvent DescriptionThe ways in which a society collects, processes, and manages information has profound effects. Its ability to organize and mobilize resources¬† , recognize and respond to threats, and understand the world around is coextensive with its ability to efficiently process information. In the nineteenth century, many, if not all, of the key aspects of information management were influenced by print and its associated technologies. Most obviously, the availability of books shaped how information moved within society. But less obviously, the density, volume, and form of those books affected activities as disparate as arithmetic calculation, surveying, accounting, natural historical research, and geographical exploration. In short, technologies of print helped determine what information was available, at what volume, and at what speed.This talk will outline some key conclusions about the relationship between print and these aspects of information processing in nineteenth century China, while making some broader arguments about the significance of information history. In particular, I contend that information history can help us bringscaleback into focus. Isolated examples of complex information practices can be extrapolated too far, while most of society is unaffected. Indeed, the industrial and political revolutions of modernity are scalar at heart: it is their mass character (for instance, the ability to reproduce practices through print) that gives them significance. Furthermore, information also allows us to move beyond studies of political bureaucracy alone, to think about how ideas, technologies, and techniques mattered in large scale changes. This is not a study about Qing imperial administration, though it touches on that topic obliquely. Instead, it is about how material and technical conditions (especially as they affected the middle levels of society‚Äîmerchants, clerks, local officials, etc.) informed the possibility of that state‚Äôs power; it is, as far as possible, a bottom-up history of information systems.John Aleknais a historian of technology and information, currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the History of Science, Technology and Medicine at Peking University. His recent book,Seeking News, Making China: Information, Technology, and the Emergence of Mass Society(Stanford University Press, 2024), investigates the ways that information technologies and social practices interacted to create new political orders in the twentieth century. He is now working on two new book manuscripts. The first is a biography of a nineteenth-century Chinese scientist-mathematician who commanded an exploratory expedition through Southeast Asia and India in 1879. The second project is a bottom-up history of information ideologies, technologies, and practices in nineteenth-century China.¬† ¬†Analysing an informational divergence in print, mathematics, geographical knowledge, and fiscal accounting, it reveals that material restrictions on information processing and management could have large-scale sociopolitical consequences.

Over more than two centuries of scholarly inquiry, research has gradually focused on three primary candidates: GandhƒÅra, Kashmir, and Kapisa. Some scholars have regarded these three as mutually exclusive possibilities, while others have suggested that the designation shifted linearly over time and across dynasties. Based on a close and critical reading of Chinese historical sources, Prof. Liu hope to argue thatJibinreferred, for the most part, to GandhƒÅra or Greater GandhƒÅra. Only during a relatively brief period‚Äîfrom the early 6th to the early 7th century‚Äîdid the name designate the Kashmir Valley. This conclusion is significant for understanding the similarities and differences in the development of Buddhism between GandhƒÅra and Kashmir as reflected in Chinese sources. For example, Chinese historical sources indicate that Buddhism in the GandhƒÅra region embraced both MahƒÅyƒÅna and multiple schools of early Buddhism, while Buddhism in the Kashmir Valley was primarily associated with the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school. Owing to its mountainous surroundings, the Kashmir Valley developed a more closed and conservative form of Buddhism. IfJibinis vaguely understood‚Äîas it has often been in past scholarship‚Äîas referring interchangeably to both Kashmir and GandhƒÅra, we risk overlooking the important distinctions and connections between these two neighboring regions, which, despite their proximity, often belonged to different political entities and followed divergent paths in the history of Buddhism.Liu Yiis the Dean of the School of History at Capital Normal University in Beijing, China. His research specializes in Dunhuang and Silk Road studies, and the history and art of Buddhism and Daoism in medieval China. He has authored ten books and published approximately 170 scholarly articles, most of them in Chinese. From 1996 to 2016, his work concentrated on Daoism, after which he turned his attention to Buddhist eschatology, especially prophecies concerning the final phase of the Dharma. His current research explores the ancient routes linking China with northwestern India via the Pamirs and the Upper Indus valley.In his lecture onJibin, Prof. Liu will address a long-standing and unresolved issue in international scholarship over the past two centuries. Drawing on a meticulous analysis of Chinese historical texts, he proposes a fresh and original interpretation of the term‚Äôs geographical and historical significance.SponsorThe East Asian Studies Program",

Instead, the state and its officials view business as primarily political actors, demanding political services from firms to advance political objectives. Politicizing Business demonstrates that the politicization of firms is rooted in authoritarianism, often harming business interests and undermining China's efforts to attract and retain investment. Explaining the seemingly arbitrary state takeover of sectors and firms, this book uncovers previously overlooked forms of politicization and demonstrates how politicizing business often creates conflicts between the state and firms, particularly private firms, leading to a state-dominated market in many sectors. Combining academic rigor with exceptionally rich data and analysis, including hundreds of in-depth interviews with government officials and business leaders, original datasets and case studies, Politicizing Business offers fresh insights into China's political economy model and explores what the Party-state demands from companies, how compliance is enforced, when and where firms are politicized, and its impact on China's development.Ning Lengis an Assistant Professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University.¬†Dr. Leng specializes in¬†the political economy of China and Global China, and the institutional effects of authoritarianism.

      "description": "DateNov 12, 2025,4:30 pm‚Äì6:00 pmLocation202 Jones HallSpeakerJiayi ChenDetailsEvent DescriptionWhy do numbers feel so essential to gaming experience? From health bars visualizing characters‚Äô life force to scoring systems monitoring players‚Äô performance and progression, contemporary gaming culture reflects our deep investment in converting abstract actions and experiences into numerical data. But this practice of what Ben Egliston calls ‚Äúquantified play‚Äù‚Äîusing data to track, condition, and reshape gaming behaviors‚Äîis not confined to digital interfaces. This talk traces how early modern Chinese game designers and authors¬†used numbers to reframe random acts of dice and coin tosses in both actual play and literary imaginations of games of chance. In official promotion games likeHan guan yiÊº¢ÂÆòÂÑÄ (Han Dynasty Bureaucracy), the numerical logic embodied in dice translates unquantifiable human behaviors and reorganizes historical narratives into a quantified knowledge system, inviting players to reflect on tensions between human agency and institutional order. This quantification logic extends beyond actual games into narrative forms that mirror gaming structures. The episodic structure of ¬†stories like ‚ÄúFor One Penny, A Small Grudge Ends in Stark Tragedies‚Äù (‰∏ÄÊñáÈí±Â∞èÈöôÈÄ†Â•áÂÜ§) transforms the randomness found in coin-tossing games into frameworks for moral and monetary calculation. In turn, it prompts readers to practicesuanÁÆó (calculating/foretelling) and trains them to perceive life‚Äôs contingencies against a higher moral order that emphasizes strict accounting between actions and consequences. By unpacking this historically specific form of quantified play that transformed fate and daily behaviors into calculable systems, this talk reexamines the significance of numbers as an epistemological device for navigating contingency, assigning value, and reconciling human agency with cosmic and moral order within the shifting economic and social landscape of early modern China.Jiayi Chenis an assistant professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Washington University in St. Louis. Her research focuses on early modern Chinese literature and culture, particularly their intersections with games, theater, visual and material culture, and the history of books and reading. Her current book project, tentatively titledThe Early Modern Ludic: Gaming and Literary Culture in China, studies how the critical potential of games to model reading, learning, and thinking, thereby cultivating new epistemological perspectives for navigating reality. Her other research interests include early modern Chinese discourses on immersion, magic, and cultural exchanges in East Asia.SponsorThe East Asian Studies Program",

      "description": "DateDec 3, 2025,4:30 pm‚Äì6:00 pmLocation202 JonesSpeakerJohn KanbayashiAffiliationUniversity of PennsylvaniaDetailsEvent DescriptionObservers of environmental policy in Japan have long celebrated an approach towards ameliorating lowland flooding that emphasizes planting trees in upland watersheds‚Äìwhat is calledchisan chisui(Ê≤ªÂ±±Ê≤ªÊ∞¥). In this talk, I interrogate both the conceptual foundations of this strategy and its consequences for peoples in spaces colonized by the Japanese Empire. In the early 1910s, devastating inundations of Taiwan's coastal areas led Japanese colonial foresters to travel upriver into mountainous areas. Driven by the conviction that attacking the problem of flooding at its source required controlling headwater areas, there they came to define highland Indigenous environmental practice‚Äìrather than natural conditions‚Äìasthefundamental cause of downstream flooding. Taming Taiwan's chaotic rivers thus entailed not only afforestation and hydraulic infrastructure but also violently reforming Indigenous livelihoods. Though contested, this interpretation ofchisan chisuibecame dominant in colonial Taiwan.Tracing the upstream movement of Japanese knowledge production and colonial power helps to explain subsequent developments in Taiwan, from the construction of large-scale hydropower systems to the expulsion of Indigenous communities from the island's highest watersheds. In highlighting disjunctures between imperial logics and colonial conditions in Japanese Taiwan, I aim to underline a broader interplay between discourses of ecological interconnectedness and culpability.John Kanbayashiis assistant professor of History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania. His current book project,Hydraulic Taiwan, uses rivers and watersheds in Taiwan to understand how Japanese imperialism remade ecologies and societies. It argues that Japanese approaches to watershed governance became fundamental to the extension of state power to remote regions both during and after colonial rule. His other active research interests include climate science in Japan and agricultural colonization across the Japanese diaspora.SponsorProgram in East Asian Studies",

      "description": "Thurs 9/18 @ 6:00PM\nLabyrinth Books, 122 Nassau Street\n\nRoy Scranton discusses his new book Impasse: Climate Change and the Limits of Progress with Andrew Cole\nExtreme heat, fires, floods, and storms are transforming our planet. Instead of serious responses from world leaders, we get divisive politics and false solutions that offer more of the same: more capitalism, more complexity, more &quot;progress.&quot;\nThe impasse we face is not only political and institutional, but cognitive, existential, and narrative. We&#039;re incapable of grasping the scale, speed, and impact of global warming. Our brains can&#039;t make sense of how radically our world is changing and we optimistically cling to a civilizational narrative that promises a better tomorrow if we just keep doing what we&#039;re doing.\nRoy Scranton argues it is well past time to free ourselves from our dangerous and dogmatic faith in progress. Such unwarranted optimism will only accelerate our collective disintegration. If we want to have any hope at all for the future, it must be grounded in a recognition of human limits&amp;mdash;a view Scranton calls ethical pessimism.\nDrawing from psychology, philosophy, history, and politics, as well as film, literature, and personal experience, Scranton describes the challenges we face in making sense of our predicament, from problems in communication to questions of justice, from the inherent biases in human perception to the difficulties of empirical knowledge. What emerges is a challenging but ultimately hopeful proposition: if we have the courage to accept our limits, we may find a way to embrace our unknowable future.\nRoy Scranton is the author of several books, including Learning to Die in the Anthropocene, Total Mobilization: World War II and American Literature, and the novel War Porn. A 2024 Guggenheim Fellow, Scranton teaches at the University of Notre Dame, where he directs the Environmental Humanities Initiative.\nAndrew Cole is the Woodrow Wilson Professor of Literature in the Department of English at Princeton University. His recent work focuses on the built environment, architecture, utopian planning, and the dialectic of space in thinkers from Hegel to Fanon. His next book is Being and Space.\nThis event is presented by Labyrinth Books and co-sponsored* by Princeton University&amp;rsquo;s Department of English, Humanities Council, and High Meadows Environmental Institute.\n*Sponsorship of an event does not constitute departmental or institutional endorsement of the specific program, speakers or views presented.",

Is international leadership no longer central to US security and prosperity? Or do the costs of leadership simply exceed the benefits? Does the US need to reduce its international role and commitments, or is this reduced international footprint a mistake? Frank Lavin takes us back to the Reagan era of Cold War foreign policy for an examination of what worked during that period and in what ways might America have fallen short - and discusses why the lessons of that era still might apply today, as different as circumstances might be.Frank Lavin served in the White House during the Reagan¬†presidency, a moment he captures in his just-published \"Inside the Reagan White House.\" After the Reagan¬†Administration, Lavin went on to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Singapore and U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade.

      "description": "During past decades, genomics and metagenomics have developed very fast, and are widely applied to non-model species especially wild animals to provide new insights to properly conserve the wildlife. The giant panda is not only the symbol of the world biodiversity conservation, but also a model to address questions of the evolutionary biology, especially the adaptive evolution to specialized bamboo diet. In this talk, I will address the population history, adaptive evolution to the bamboo diet from different aspects such morphology, behavior, ecology, physiology, genetics, genomics and metagenomics of gut microbiomes. Finally, I will talk about how these new findings will be benefit to the conservation and management of giant pandas.About the speaker: Dr. Fuwen Wei holds a Bachelor Degree in Biology and Masters Degree in Zoology from China West Normal University, and a Ph.D. from the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He has been working as a Principal Investigator in the Institute of Zoology, CAS and served as the Deputy Director of the Institute from 2008‚Äì2017. Dr. Wei received the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars from the National Natural Science Foundation of China in 2001. He was elected as an Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017, an Academician of The World Academy of Sciences in 2018, and an Academician of Academia Europaea in 2021. He won the CAS Outstanding Science and Technology Achievement Award in 2018 and the China Natural Science Award in 2019.Dr. Wei's research has focused on conservation biology and molecular ecology of endangered animals, and he is a pioneer in the conservation genomics and metagenomics of endangered animals. He has applied genetic and genomic techniques to assess the evolutionary past, present and future of giant panda populations; infer the processes and causes that threaten them; reveal their adaptive mechanisms to specialized bamboo diet; and propose science-based conservation strategies for their long-term survival. His research offers a framework for endangered animal study.--The David Bradford Energy and Environmental Policy Seminar Series is coordinated by the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (C-PREE), and co-sponsored by the High Meadows Environmental Institute (HMEI).

In a draft paper, Akash Kapur and Arvind Narayanan adapt Cory Doctorow‚Äôs enshittification thesis to AI, and argue that degradation of quality is possible or even likely. Some of the reasons why AI products might get worse are familiar ones, such as market power due to user lock-in, while others are new, arising from geopolitical pressures on AI companies.

      "description": "In 2022, the United Nations General Assembly formally recognized the human right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. While this builds on the long-established right to health, it also broadens the scope of protection. Professor Hiroaki Matsuura will discuss his research on the distinct roles that the rights to health and to a healthy environment play in shaping population health outcomes across Latin American countries, where these rights have been recognized through national constitutions and the San Salvador Protocol. Although both aim to promote health and well-being, his analysis found that constitutional recognition of the right to health was associated with a measurable decline in infant mortality among poor families‚Äîhighlighting its potential for immediate, targeted benefits to vulnerable populations. By contrast, the constitutional right to a healthy environment was not linked to short-term improvements in infant survival but correlated with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, pointing to a longer-term, systemic contribution to public health. These findings suggest a division of labor between the two rights: the right to health primarily protects current generations, especially the poor, while the right to a healthy environment helps lay the foundation for healthier lives in the future. Both are essential, but they function through different pathways and over different time horizons‚Äîunderscoring the importance of the term¬†‚Äúsustainable‚Äù¬†in the UN‚Äôs framing of this right.Hiroaki Matsuura is currently Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs at Shoin University in Japan. He is also Professor in the Faculty of Tourism, Media and Cultural Studies. He has been a member of the World Health Organization's Technical Advisory Group on the Economics of Environment, Climate Change and Health, the Technical Advisory Group on Embedding Ethics in Health and Climate Change Policy, and the World Tourism Organization's World Committee on Tourism Ethics.

In this seminar, Mike Schmidt ‚Äî founding Director of the CHIPS Program Office ‚Äî shares lessons from inside the process: how industrial policy is crafted, how it‚Äôs executed, and what it takes to make it endure. Drawing on his experience leading the $39 billion CHIPS manufacturing initiative, Schmidt will explore both the craft and political economy of modern industrial policy, offering practical insights for future efforts to advance strategic national goals ‚Äî from revitalizing domestic manufacturing to accelerating the clean energy transition.Michael R. Schmidtis a distinguished visitor at the Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies at Princeton University. From September 2022 to January 2025, Schmidt served as the inaugural director of the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce, where he led the implementation of a $39 billion federal initiative to incentivize semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Under his leadership, the office executed 20 final award agreements totaling $34 billion, unlocking more than $450 billion in total investment in U.S. chip production. Before joining the commerce department, Schmidt led the U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs implementation of the expanded Child Tax Credit under the American Rescue Plan, which delivered monthly payments to over 37 million families and lifted more than 3 million children out of poverty. He previously served as commissioner of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, overseeing the state‚Äôs tax system and the collection of more than $100 billion in annual revenue; and as deputy secretary for economic development for the State of New York, where he directed policy and operations across 12 state agencies and authorities. Earlier in his career, he held roles in the Office of Domestic Finance at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and as a financial analyst at the Yale Investments Office. Schmidt holds a BA in history and a JD, both from Yale University. Current research focuses on developing a principled framework for when industrial policy interventions are justified to advance U.S. national security. Drawing on his experience leading the CPO, he seeks to move beyond ad hoc interventions by clarifying the conditions under which government action is warranted.

      "description": "In his farewell speech on January 15, 2025, President Joe Biden warned about ‚Äúthe potential rise of a tech-industrial complex.‚Äù To use the ‚Äúindustrial complex‚Äù phrase, as Biden must have known, is to risk association with a strongly conspiratorial bent in U.S. culture and politics. Nevertheless, the ‚Äúindustrial complex‚Äù captures an important idea: that legal institutions can, whether intentionally or unwittingly, foster forms of power and influence that threaten to break free of liberal constraints.This project charts the rise and impact of tech companies in public governance. It both maps the legal origins of the tech-industrial complex and describes the entrenchment of tech companies within the state itself. Bloch-Wehba argues that seeing the tech-industrial complex as a key instrument of contemporary governance also illuminates problematic disjunctions between constitutional doctrine and our contemporary political order.Bio:Hannah Bloch-Wehba is CITP‚Äôs Microsoft Visiting Professor for fall 2025. She is a legal scholar, expert on law and technology, and member of the faculty at Texas A&M University School of Law. Her scholarship focuses on how technological change reshapes public governance, with consequences for civil liberties, transparency, and accountability.¬†Her award-winning articles on these topics have appeared or are forthcoming in the Indiana Law Journal, Northwestern University Law Review, California Law Review, BYU Law Review, Berkeley Technology Law Journal, Fordham Law Review, and many other journals. Bloch-Wehba‚Äôs fellowships include the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) and the Weizenbaum Institute (Berlin). Prior to joining the faculty at Texas A&M, Bloch-Wehba taught at Drexel University‚Äôs Thomas R. Kline School of Law and at Yale Law School. She is also an affiliated fellow at Yale Law School‚Äôs¬†Information Society Project and an affiliated scholar at NYU School of Law‚Äôs¬†Policing Project. Bloch-Wehba is a graduate of NYU School of Law, where she was an¬†Institute for International Law & Justice/Law and Security Scholar, and of the University of Texas at Austin.In-person attendance is open to Princeton University faculty, staff and students.This talk will be livestreamed and recorded.

Recognizing the critical juncture at which Afghanistan finds itself, there is a pressing need to reevaluate and strengthen international engagement through an inclusive and participatory framework, where all Afghans feel included. The Mosaic Approach, introduced through UNAMA‚Äôs Comprehensive Framework, represents a potential important pathway to address these challenges; however, it requires significant recalibration to ensure inclusivity, accountability, and transparency.This event will discuss the current status of the Mosaic Approach, highlighting opportunities for reinforcing Afghan-led solutions, expanding democratic and representative spaces, safeguarding human rights‚Äîespecially those of women and marginalized groups‚Äîand ensuring the Afghan people's aspirations are central to international engagement.There are various approaches to help to strengthen the current process, by including divers Afghan representation and civil society organizations, enhancing the accountability metrics, and prioritizing human rights values and inclusive governance.This event will engage policymakers, Afghan civil society representatives, human rights experts, and UN stakeholders to identify actionable recommendations and outline concrete steps toward a more robust, participatory, and accountable Mosaic Approach.Objectives:To review and discuss the current Mosaic Approach and propose substantive improvements, emphasizing inclusive governance and meaningful participation of diverse Afghan representation.To highlight the urgency of developing clear, measurable benchmarks and accountability mechanisms for any engagement with the Taliban.To underscore the importance of a participatory approach involving Afghan civil society, women‚Äôs groups, youth representatives, and minority communities.To advocate for a human rights-centric framework that prioritizes women's rights, political inclusivity, and democratic governance.",

With an exceptional ability to see challenges and solutions from multiple perspectives, a proven record of assembling dynamic teams, and a listen-first leadership approach coupled with clear-eyed decisiveness, Chiquita has positively transformed organizations that are making a significant impact across the nation.Brooks-LaSure served as the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from 2021 to 2025. This government agency oversees over $1.4 trillion in annual spending, provides health coverage to more than 160 million Americans, and oversees health, safety, and performance standards at over 20,000 U.S. hospitals, nursing homes, and other health facilities. An average week for the CMS Administrator includes billion-dollar decisions and direct engagement with health leaders, advocates, Congressional leadership, governors, mayors, and Fortune 100 CEOs.As Administrator, Chiquita assembled and led a diverse senior staff, along with 6,000 dedicated agency employees and over 30,000 contractors, in delivering record-breaking results for the American people. Under her leadership, CMS doubled health coverage under the Affordable Care Act from 12 to 24 million enrollees, expanded and strengthened Medicaid, raised maternal health standards, and led negotiations with Fortune 100 corporations to lower prescription drug prices. These negotiations are estimated to save $6 billion in overall costs and $1.5 billion for Medicare enrollees in the first year alone.Chiquita met and exceeded the policy goals of the Biden-Harris Administration with an administrative budget of less than 1 percent of total expenditures, guiding the agency through budget shortfalls, establishing clear lines of accountability for CMS to work more effectively across offices, and strengthened internal operations to address cybersecurity and improve accountability fromcontractors.She brought to CMS her experience at consulting firms Avalere Health and Manatt Health, where she provided nuanced and actionable insights on Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act to leaders of health plans, hospital systems, pharmaceutical companies, and advocacy organizations.She helped clients pivot in the midst of a changing federal and state policy landscape, preparing them for ACA repeal efforts and crafting state initiatives on health care cost containment, consumer affordability, and network adequacy. Through her thought leadership, she also spurred meaningful policy discussions on health equity and maternal health.Chiquita played an instrumental role in the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, first as a legislative aide on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee and following the ACA‚Äôs passage, at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Modern Healthcare named Chiquita the most influential person in healthcare in 2023, and Time Magazine included her among the 100 most influential global health leaders and ‚Äúmost admired women‚Äù leaders. A member of the National Academy of Medicine, Chiquita received a bachelor‚Äôs degree from Princeton University and a master‚Äôs degree in public policy from Georgetown University.She is married with one daughter.Sponsorship of an event does not constitute institutional endorsement of external speakers or views presented.Please note that registration does not guarantee admission to the event.

      "description": "People¬†60 and over are the internet‚Äôs fastest growing demographic. Many myths surround¬†older adults‚Äô online behavior such as lacking in skills and being constantly duped. Yet research shows that many in this age group are savvy and are in fact less likely to fall for online scams than younger adults. In this talk, Eszter Hargittai shares some key insights from her bookWired Wisdomwith John Palfrey about how older adults are incorporating digital media into their lives and what they, their support networks, policy makers, and companies can do to make these experiences more beneficial.Bio:Eszter Hargittai is a professor and holds the Chair in Internet Use & Society in the Department of Communication and Media Research at the University of Zurich. She is the author or editor of six books, most recently, Wired Wisdom: How to Age Better Online (University of Chicago Press, 2025) co-authored with John Palfrey. Hargittai‚Äôs research focuses on the social and policy implications of digital media with a particular interest in digital inequality, how differences in people‚Äôs digital skills influence what they do online, and how these may translate into changes in life chances.

      "description": "Relationships with artificial intelligence (AI) agents such as companion chatbots are on the rise. Concerns that these relationships may harm or replace real human relationships have been raised, but whether and how these social consequences occur remains unclear. Prior research suggests that people‚Äôs states of social need and their anthropomorphism of the AI agent may play a role in how human-AI interaction impacts human-human interaction.In this longitudinal study (N = 183), participants were randomly assigned to text chat with a companion chatbot or engage in text-based word games for at least 10 minutes a day for 21 days. Data was collected via two interviews and four surveys. Results suggested that people who had a higher desire to socially connect anthropomorphized the chatbot more. Those who anthropomorphized the chatbot more indicated that the interaction had greater impacts on their social interactions and relationships with family and friends. A mediation analysis suggested that the impact of human-AI interaction on human-human outcomes is mediated by the extent to which people anthropomorphize the AI agent, which may be motivated by a desire to socially connect.Bio:Rose E. Guingrich is a Ph.D. candidate in Psychology and Social Policy at Princeton University, an NSF Fellow, and a Social Impact Fellow at All Tech is Human.

      "description": "BiographyStephen B. Heintz is president and CEO of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a private family foundation with an endowment of approximately $1.2 billion that advances social change for a more just, sustainable, and peaceful world. Heintz coined the term ‚Äúacupuncture philanthropy‚Äù to describe his philanthropic approach of leveraging modest financial assets to trigger larger systemic change on critical issues.Heintz, who began his professional life in public service for the state of Connecticut, has devoted his career to strengthening democratic culture and institutions to better serve citizens. Before joining the RBF in 2001, Heintz co-founded and served as president of Dƒìmos, a public policy organization that works to reduce political and economic inequality and to broaden citizen engagement in American democracy. As co-chair of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences national Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship, he co-authored the report Our Common Purpose: Reinventing American Democracy for the 21st Century (2020).On the international stage, Heintz served as executive vice president and chief operating officer for the EastWest Institute during the 1990s. Based in Prague, he helped propel civil society development, economic reform, and new international security structures in Central and Eastern Europe‚Äôs then burgeoning democracies. In 2012, Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski awarded the Officer‚Äôs Cross ‚Äì Order of Merit to Heintz in recognition of his work to help build democratic institutions in Poland.In 2002, he led the RBF‚Äôs joint initiative with the UN Association of the USA to open a Track II dialogue that helped lay the groundwork for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. In 2007, Heintz convened a meeting of the Kosovo Unity Team and prominent global diplomatic figures at the Fund‚Äôs Pocantico Center, resulting in the Pocantico Declaration that set a path for the Kosovo independence process. Heintz is the author of ‚ÄúA Logic for the Future: International Relations in the Age of Turbulence‚Äù (2024).In 2010, Heintz set an ambitious path to align investment of the Fund‚Äôs financial assets with its mission, resulting in its 2014 decision to divest from fossil fuels and establishing the RBF as a leader in mission-aligned investing.Heintz is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. He chairs the board of the Quincy Institute and serves on the boards of the International Crisis Group and the Rockefeller Archive Center.

      "description": "Twenty years after Facebook spread across college campuses, its effects on society remain heavily studied and poorly understood. Little consensus exists over whether it promotes or degrades mental health, heals divides or polarizes, alters electoral outcomes or foments extremism. Repeated failure to reach scientific consensus about its effects‚Äîmuch less identify workable, scalable and effective solutions‚Äîsuggests a deeper suite of problems.First, scientific approaches to understanding social media‚Äôs impacts rarely take into account complexity: causes and effects span time and organizational complexity. Second, failing to account for these features can undermine and bias causal estimates from ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù tools of science readily deployed elsewhere, leading to ostensibly large effects appearing to evaporate on experimental investigation.Finally, industry funding has been a major component of the field since its inception, which can disrupt consensus formation even in a field composed of entirely earnest researchers whose integrity cannot be bought. Moving from era in which social media is a driving economic force into one replete with a menagerie of artificial intelligences will require science learning from past failures and recalibrating to meet the challenges ahead.Bio:Joe Bak-Coleman is a collective behavior scientist at the University of Washington and an applied external fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. He earned his Ph.D. at Princeton University and went on to complete postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Washington and the Columbia School of Journalism. His research explores how the flow of information through groups impacts their ability to make decisions amidst uncertainty. Leveraging mathematical theory, statistical analysis, and experimental methods, he has studied collective behavior across diverse contexts; from zebra herds and fish schools to social media users and in scientific communities. In addition to his academic research, he has served as a consulting expert for the United Nations and has a forthcoming book,Of Fish and Fascists,due out in early 2027.

      "description": "Forty years ago last month, about 70 climate scientists and environmental policy analysts convened in the Austria town of Villach for a conference organized under the auspices of UNEP, the WMO and ICSU titled, ‚ÄòAn Assessment of the Role of Carbon Dioxide and of Other Greenhouse Gases in Climate Variations and Associated Impacts‚Äô.¬†This meeting is widely regarded as laying the foundations for establishing an ‚Äòinternational climate change regime‚Äô for controlling human influences on the climate system.¬† Managing the risks of a changing global climate has been framed in many ways over the intervening 40 years.¬† During this period, the world has warmed by nearly 1¬∞C but‚Äîperhaps more importantly‚Äîit has also changed geopolitically in unpredicted ways.¬† In this talk, I will briefly survey the changing policy framing of climate change since Villach in 1985, and what these frames have and have not achieved.¬† As the international climate regime originally designed in the 1990s continues to strain, and begins to fragment, new ways of thinking about the ‚Äòclimate issue‚Äô are needed.¬†Rather than being a planetary emergency, climate change feels more like a political epic: ‚Äúa process of collective human effort that features gradual progression through time, obscure problem origins, and anticlimactic outcomes.‚ÄùBio:Mike Hulme is professor of human geography at the University of Cambridge. ¬†Prior to joining Cambridge in 2017, he held academic positions at King‚Äôs College London, the University of East Anglia, the University of Salford (1984-1988), and been a visiting academic at the University of Zimbabwe (Harare) and at the Rachel Carson Centre at Ludwig Maximilian University, M√ºnich.¬† Hulme‚Äôs¬†work¬†illuminates the numerous ways in which¬†the idea of climate change is deployed in public, political, religious and scientific discourse.¬† He is¬†the author of over 170 peer-reviewed articles and 12 books on climate change including, most recently, ‚ÄòClimate Change Isn‚Äôt Everything: Liberating Climate Politics from Alarmism‚Äô (Polity, 2023) and, co-editor, ‚ÄòA Critical Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‚Äô (CUP, 2022).¬† He is the author of the widely acclaimed ‚ÄòWhy We Disagree About Climate Change‚Äô (CUP, 2009).¬† From 2000 to 2007, Hulme was the Founding Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, and between 2009 and 2020 was the founding editor-in-chief of the review journalWIREs Climate Change.¬† In 2007 he received a personal certificate recognising his contribution to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the IPCC.--The David Bradford Energy and Environmental Policy Seminar Series is coordinated by the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (C-PREE), and co-sponsored by the High Meadows Environmental Institute (HMEI).
