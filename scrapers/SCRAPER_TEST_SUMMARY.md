## Overall Summary

- **Total Events Collected**: 499 events
- **Working Scrapers**: 22 out of 23 (95.7% success rate)
- **Failed Scrapers**: 1 (French & Italian - DNS issue)
- **No Events Found**: 1 (Art & Archaeology)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Date Parsing Issues
- **Physics & Geosciences**: Fixed timezone-aware datetime parsing for JSON feeds
- **ORFE**: Fixed date parsing to handle format "Sep 8, 2025" (without day of week)

### 2. Code Quality Issues
- **Physics Scraper**: Removed duplicate code that was causing syntax errors

## Test Commands

### Individual Scrapers
```bash
# Test all individual scrapers
python test_individual_scrapers.py

# Test specific scraper
python test_individual_scrapers.py physics
python test_individual_scrapers.py philosophy
python test_individual_scrapers.py math
```

### Drupal Scrapers
```bash
# Test all Drupal departments
python test_all_drupal_departments.py all

# Test specific departments
python test_all_drupal_departments.py sociology orfe ece

# Test default set (5 departments)
python test_all_drupal_departments.py
```

### Individual Scraper Files
```bash
# Test individual scrapers directly
python physics_json_scraper.py
python geosciences_json_scraper.py
python philosophy_ics_scraper.py
python math_ics_scraper.py
```

## Data Quality

### Date Validation
- All events now have valid `start_date` fields
- Times are properly formatted (e.g., "12:15 pm", "4:30 pm")
- Date ranges are handled correctly for multi-day events

### Event Information
- Titles are properly extracted
- Locations are captured when available
- Event types are automatically determined
- Tags are generated based on content

## Next Steps

1. **Fix French & Italian scraper** - DNS resolution issue
2. **Investigate Art & Archaeology** - Why no events found
3. **Add more departments** - Expand to remaining Princeton departments
4. **Improve deduplication** - Better logic for removing duplicate events
5. **Add error handling** - More robust error handling and logging

## Files Generated

- `physics_json_events.json` - 112 Physics events
- `geosciences_json_events.json` - 86 Geosciences events
- `universal_drupal_test_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Drupal test results
- Various individual scraper output files

## Performance Notes

- **JSON scrapers**: Very fast (1-2 seconds per department)
- **ICS scrapers**: Fast (2-3 seconds per department)
- **Drupal scrapers**: Slower (5-10 seconds per department due to HTML parsing)
- **Total test time**: ~5 minutes for all scrapers
