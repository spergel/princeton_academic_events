## üîÑ MAINTENANCE TASKS

### Weekly Tasks:
1. Run `combine_cloudscraper_events.py` to collect fresh events
2. Check for new events from all 33 working sources
3. Monitor for website changes that might break scrapers

### Monthly Tasks:
1. Test failed scrapers to see if issues are resolved
2. Update scrapers if department websites change
3. Review event quality and data consistency

### Quarterly Tasks:
1. Comprehensive testing of all scrapers
2. Update best practices based on new challenges
3. Optimize scraper performance and reliability

## üìù NOTES

- **Last successful collection**: September 1, 2025
- **Data quality**: High - consistent structure across all sources
- **Anti-bot measures**: Successfully bypassed using CloudScraper
- **Fallback strategies**: Multiple methods ensure robust event collection
- **Error handling**: Individual failures don't break the entire system

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Archive successful scrapers** - Keep working code for reference
2. **Clean up scraper directory** - Remove individual scraper files
3. **Maintain combination script** - Keep the working event collection system
4. **Document API endpoints** - Some departments may have RSS feeds
5. **Consider incremental updates** - Only scrape new/changed events
