      "description": "Tues 11/4 @ 6:00PMLabyrinth Books, 122 Nassau Street\n\nIn this enthralling re-creation of American novelist Henry James&amp;rsquo; famous ten-month trip around the United States, lauded critic Peter Brooks brings to life both the literary giant and America in its Gilded Age.\nIn 1904, after two decades of living and travelling abroad, Henry James returned to the United States to discover a world drastically different from the one he had left behind. Suddenly, the future of the world seemed to be in his native land, which he had once considered provincial, lacking in nourishment for the novelist. James thus set forth to refamiliarize himself with the United States, travelling the breadth of the land and exercising his acute powers of observation to document all that he saw.\nJames&amp;rsquo;s ten-month journey across America and its product, the ethnographic work The American Scene, are the focus of Henry James Comes Home, scholar and literary critic Peter Brooks&amp;rsquo;s dazzling follow-up to his book Henry James Goes to Paris. Brooks combines biography and criticism to recreate James&amp;rsquo;s American journey, tracing his travels around New England, down south to Florida, across the Midwest, up the coast of California, and eventually to Seattle and Portland. For James, being American was &amp;ldquo;a complex fate,&amp;rdquo; and Brooks shows how James&amp;rsquo;s keen remarks on rampant materialism and the challenges at the heart of democracy are still of enduring relevance to us in this day.\nPeter Brooks is the author of The Melodramatic Imagination, Reading for the Plot, Psychoanalysis and Storytelling, Troubling Confessions, Realist Vision, Henry James Goes to Paris, and Flaubert in the Ruins of Paris, as well as two novels, World Elsewhere and The Emperor&#039;s Body. His Balzac&#039;s Lives and Seduced by Story are both published by New York Review Books, and he has edited two NYRB Classics, Balzac&#039;s The Human Comedy: Selected Stories and Vivant Denon&#039;s No Tomorrow. He is Sterling Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature at Yale.\nAnne Anlin Cheng is the author of&amp;nbsp;The Melancholy of Race: Psychoanalysis, Assimilation, and Hidden Grief; Second Skin: Josephine Baker and the Modern Surface; Ornamentalism; and Ordinary Disasters: How I Stopped Being a Model Minority.

In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics in black-hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von N",
